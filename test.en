I. ACC private meeting
A private meeting of ACC members was held on the morning of 27 October 2000, at which the Executive Heads were briefed and had an extensive exchange of views on recent political developments, including the situation in the Middle East.
The Secretary of ACC was asked to pursue arrangements, through the Executive Information Network and other means, to promote a more systematic exchange of information among executive heads on major developments of mutual concern, including in the main organs of the United Nations and other intergovernmental forums.
ACC retreat
At the invitation of the Secretary-General, ACC members held a retreat from the evening of Friday, 27 October, to Saturday, 28 October.
The main focus at the retreat was a joint reflection on concrete ways for the United Nations system to advance the objectives set in the Millennium Declaration adopted by the heads of State and Government at the conclusion of the Millennium Summit (resolution 55/2).
A note on the outcome of the discussions at the retreat will be presented separately.
The present report covers the outcome of the discussions at the regular session of the Committee.
The demands placed on national and international systems by the new global environment
The Secretary-General recalled that, for the past two years, ACC had been analysing the process of globalization and its implications for the work of the United Nations system.
The decision of ACC to give priority to this issue in its agenda, the balance sheet it had been drawing of the impact of globalization and its analysis of the linkages and synergies that needed to be created to redress the negative and exploit the positive had found strong confirmation at the Millennium Summit.
The Summit had also reinforced the belief of the members of ACC that the system had both a responsibility and the potential to contribute significantly to the new and stronger framework of governance that was required to make globalization a positive force for all.
The Secretary-General noted that globalization was drawing the system together to an extent that was, in many ways, unprecedented.
The discussion in ACC was serving to deepen significantly both the need and the rationale for system-wide cooperation.
As a result of the discussion, there was a deeper understanding within the system of the reasons why, in the face of globalization, United Nations organizations needed each other to succeed, and what they could do specifically to reinforce each other in the pursuit of both their respective mandates and their common overriding objectives, chief among them the struggle against poverty.
A. Health and other social implications of globalization
Pursuant to a decision of ACC at its spring 2000 session, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, at the invitation of the Secretary-General, convened a meeting of Executive Heads on 26 October 2000 in New York to assist in preparing for ACC's consideration of health and other social implications of globalization.
In introducing a note on the outcome of the consultation of Executive Heads, Dr. Brundtland recalled that the meeting had defined, as its central task, the challenge, reflected in the Millennium Declaration, of how to make globalization a positive force for all and how to influence its process and impact vis-à-vis bringing benefits to poor people.
Health provided very telling examples of the many positive and negative impacts of globalization.
In health, as in other sectors, ACC should focus its priorities in areas where the market alone cannot deliver positive results, identifying the types of public interventions that are required.
In taking forward the concept of the global public good, both nationally and internationally, United Nations organizations needed to focus their work in ways that made it possible to undertake integrated initiatives in key areas such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and childhood diseases.
The meeting also drew attention to potential conflicts between trade rules and global social and environmental goals.
In setting up international rules on trade and finance, the evidence-base needed to be strengthened to broaden perspectives.
Thus for example, the experiences with Trade-Related Intellectual Property (TRIPS) needed to be examined in order to better understand advantages and disadvantages, in particular the impact on sectors such as the pharmaceutical industry in developing countries.
In this regard, the Director-General of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) offered his agency's support for a study on the nexus between TRIPS and prices, incomes and manufacturing industries in developing countries, in the context of regulating global negatives and defining key public goods.
Greater awareness of global negatives and of the way globalization had fostered them was needed.
Tobacco, illicit drugs and transnational crimes were examples of global negatives that require regulation.
On the broader aspects of globalization, Dr. Brundtland noted that organizations of the system were addressing different dimensions through their mandates and perspectives.
Globalization touched on the activities of all agencies, from meteorology and maritime safety to education and the environment.
There was a need to understand the interlinkages better and to develop more integrated thinking among members of ACC as well as encourage such thinking among Member States.
It was important at the same time not to confuse the impact of globalization with other factors: national government responsibility for public policy and social outcomes remained as critical as ever.
Technological capacity was a crucial part of globalization and organizations of the system should intensify their efforts to share information and experiences on the potential of information technology, biotechnology and the human genome project.
They also needed to keep alert to “downsides”, for example different standards being applied in domestic and overseas markets.
ACC thanked the Director-General of WHO for convening the meeting of Executive Heads and endorsed the general thrust of her report.
In the discussion that ensued in ACC, it was noted that the programmes of action of United Nations conferences and summits set out broad responses to the challenges of globalization.
The key was to further integrated approaches that would serve to bring the benefits of globalization to the poor.
Executive Heads agreed that there was a need to deepen the common understanding of the synergies that had to be fostered among financial, economic, social, cultural, technological and human rights dimensions so as to strengthen the knowledge base for such integrated approaches.
Account needed to be taken of demographic trends, international migration and the needs of young people, as well as gender concerns.
A major focus of the common effort should be to enhance access to education and preserve cultural identity.
Integrated approaches were equally important in addressing the negative aspects of globalization, from drug trafficking and transnational organized crime to environmental pollution, HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases.
The underlying need to work towards a rule-based international system that was perceived as fundamentally fair was generally emphasized.
ACC also shared the emphasis placed by the meeting on the importance of identifying key areas where public policy could make a difference in addressing market distortions and in bringing about beneficial solutions.
In this context, it was noted that one of the most significant shifts in the approach of the United Nations system to development was a conscious and concerted effort to work more closely with civil society and the private sector.
The view was expressed that, in the light of the Millennium Summit, each organization of the system should draw up an action plan outlining how it will contribute to achieving the development goals and targets set out in the Millennium Declaration.
Advancing the objectives of the Declaration should be a main focus of the work of ACC in the period ahead.
Recognizing the need for more integrated thinking to address the various dimensions of globalization at the level of the United Nations system, ACC welcomed the proposal of the Director-General of ILO to prepare a paper on an integrated approach to policy formulation, identifying interrelationships among economic and social dimensions of globalization.
In endorsing the general thrust of Dr. Brundtland's report, ACC noted the intention of the Director-General of WHO to write to ACC members providing suggestions for taking forward the ideas emanating from the meeting on 26 October and the offers of cooperation that were made in that context.
It was further agreed that the High-Level Committee on Programmes, once established, should give priority to building up a network among agencies on globalization issues in order to promote integrated approaches that can influence the direction of programmes of the organizations of the system.
B. Financing for development
ACC was briefed on the preparatory process under way for this event.
A set of innovative arrangements had been put in place in this context, in particular, with the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization (WTO), including the secondment of staff from the World Bank and IMF, as well as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), to the coordinating secretariat responsible for the preparations for this event in the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.
In the ensuing discussions, ACC members noted the importance attached to this event by Member States and welcomed the involvement and participation in the preparatory process of all “relevant stakeholders”, including, in particular, the Bretton Woods institutions.
ACC members saw the event as an important opportunity to, inter alia, further the implementation of the goals and commitments of the Millennium Summit.
They also emphasized the importance for the event to address, within its agenda, interfaces between trade and financial issues and, in that context, to achieve concrete advances in debt relief and in reversing the trend of declining official development assistance (ODA).
ACC further noted that, under the heading on “mobilizing domestic financial resources for development”, the agenda covered governance issues and the overall question of the enabling domestic environment.
In the same context, the relevance of ongoing work within the system to combat money-laundering was raised.
The view was expressed that the engagement of Finance Ministers in the preparatory process and the event itself would be crucial to its success.
The Executive Heads of the Bretton Woods institutions indicated their readiness to extend their full support in promoting such engagement.
ACC members also welcomed the involvement and participation in the process of the United Nations regional commissions, in collaboration with development banks and other development actors at the regional level.
The importance of the contribution of civil society and non-governmental organizations to the process was generally emphasized.
The hope was expressed that upcoming events in 2001, in particular, the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries and the high-level event on financing for development, will build on each other and will have outcomes that are mutually reinforcing.
Members of ACC expressed strong support for the high-level event on financing for development and gave assurances of the full participation of their organizations in the preparatory process and the event itself.
C. Least developed countries
At its spring 2000 session, ACC decided to revisit issues relating to the least developed countries, both in the context of the forthcoming Third United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries, and in relation to progress in the implementation of the Integrated Framework for Trade-related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries.
The Secretary-General of UNCTAD briefed ACC on the challenges ahead in the context of the forthcoming Conference on the Least Developed Countries in Brussels.
He drew attention to the stark conditions in the 48 least developed countries, noting that most of the 614 million people in these countries subsisted on less than a dollar a day and that only four of those countries were on course to graduate from the group by 2015, and only another eight over the next 50 years.
Since 33 of the 48 least developed countries were in Africa, that was a situation which particularly afflicted that continent: it was incumbent on the international community to make every possible effort to improve the conditions of life for the people in the African and other least developed countries.
The Brussels Conference was a challenging test case for the United Nations system, particularly in the context of the follow-up to the Millennium Summit and its Declaration, to demonstrate that it could, collectively, make a real difference.
He called upon members of ACC to commit themselves and their organizations to work for the achievement of a successful Conference, which would deliver not speeches but an “early harvest” of actions towards the goals agreed by all in the major United Nations conferences of the 1990s and at the Millennium Summit.
Following an exchange of views, ACC adopted a statement on the Third United Nations Conference on the least developed countries as follows:
ACC considers the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, to be held in Brussels from 14 to 20 May 2001, as a major milestone in the United Nations system-wide efforts, in the context of a globalizing world, towards accelerating development and poverty eradication, promoting peace and security, protecting the vulnerable and preserving the common environment.
ACC notes that the Conference will assess the results of the Programme of Action for the least developed countries for the 1990s at the country-level and review the implementation of international support measures, particularly in the areas of official development assistance (ODA), debt, investment and trade.
It will also consider the formulation and adoption of a new programme of action for least developed countries for the current decade, containing appropriate national and international policies and measures for sustainable development of the least developed countries and their progressive integration into the world economy.
In this regard, ACC welcomes the commitment of the heads of State and Government, in the Millennium Declaration, to address the special needs of least developed countries, as well as their pledge of full support to ensuring the success of the Conference.
ACC takes note of the four-track preparatory process of the Conference, namely, an intergovernmental track focusing on the formulation of a new programme of action; a country-level track to prepare national-level programmes of action for individual least developed countries; an “early deliverables” track leading to specific actions and initiatives for immediate implementation; and a civil society track bringing together the various stakeholders, including lawmakers and other civil society actors and the business community in the least developed countries and their development partner countries in support of the Conference.
ACC declares the full commitment of the organizations individually, and the United Nations system collectively, to strongly support the Conference secretariat, led by the Secretary-General of UNCTAD, in the preparations for the Conference along all the above tracks of the preparatory process.
On behalf of the entire system, it expresses the readiness of the organizations to advance the objectives of the Conference with a view to accelerating growth and development and the eradication of poverty in the least developed countries.
It also recognizes that a decent standard of living, adequate nutrition, health care, decent work and protection against calamities are not just development goals — they are also human rights.
ACC pledges to mobilize all parts of the United Nations system to work in partnership with all stakeholders, including policy makers in the least developed countries and their development partners, to make globalization work for the least developed countries by supporting their efforts to build the requisite productive, human and institutional capacities, as well as by helping to create a conducive international environment for their beneficial integration into the world economy, and to ensure sustainable development of the least developed countries and of their citizens by promoting good governance, respect for human rights, including protection of the most vulnerable and protection of the common environment.
At the spring 2000 session of ACC, Executive Heads recognized the critical importance of the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries, agreed to accelerate its implementation and requested WTO to report back to ACC at its next session.
The Director-General of WTO briefed ACC on the progress achieved in implementing the Integrated Framework.
He reported that the six core agencies (IMF, World Bank, UNDP, UNCTAD, the International Trade Centre UNCTAD/WTO (ITC) and WTO) had met in July 2000 and agreed on new arrangements to strengthen the Integrated Framework, inter alia, by: the mainstreaming of trade priorities into the national development and poverty reduction strategies of the least developed countries; improved inter-agency governance and coordination arrangements; a division of labour among the core agencies; and the proposed establishment of a trust fund to seek donor support and voluntary contributions for the Integrated Framework.
ACC welcomed the progress achieved thus far in implementing the Integrated Framework and underscored the need to mobilize resources in support of the least developed countries, particularly in the context of the forthcoming Conference and the proposed trust fund for the Integrated Framework.
ACC agreed to pursue, at its next session, its reflection on the challenges that globalization poses for the United Nations system, in the light of a paper to be presented by the Director-General of ILO on an integrated approach to policy formulation, identifying interrelationships among the economic and social aspects of globalization (see also para.
In introducing this item, the Secretary-General drew attention to the notes before ACC on the proposed functions of the two High-Level Committees and on the single, jointly financed ACC secretariat, and thanked ACC members for their cooperation in the reform process.
He also thanked the chairpersons of the two meetings at which the proposed terms of reference for the two Committees had been prepared.
He noted that, if it concurred with the recommendations of these two meetings, ACC would, through the establishment of the two new High-Level Committees, have the pillars in place that would enable it to concentrate on strategic issues — a main objective that had moved the review forward.
One was to ensure that, without prejudice to current procedures and the provision of dedicated services to the different inter-agency committees, ACC could count on coherent and well-coordinated support from both New York and Geneva.
The second was to consolidate secretariat capacities to promote a more effective exchange and dissemination of comprehensive information on the work of the system and to maximize support for the “task managers” and “lead agency” approaches that should guide the functioning of the reformed ACC machinery.
Noting that the two inter-agency meetings had left the task of redefining subsidiary structure to the two High-Level Committees, the Secretary-General pointed out that the note before ACC on the consolidated secretariat could not, for that reason, include details of organizational structure and budget for the consolidated ACC secretariat.
The note suggested therefore keeping inter-agency financed budgets at current levels for the coming biennium and reviewing and adjusting them as the new streamlined subsidiary structure was agreed upon.
This, however, was predicated on the assumption that the current level of secondments would continue in the immediate period ahead in relation to the ACC secretariat in New York.
In this connection, he thanked UNIDO, UNFPA and UNDP for the support so far extended to the Office for Inter-Agency Affairs and hoped that such support would continue in the coming biennium.
He also expressed the hope that under the new cost-sharing arrangement that will be worked out, the World Bank, IMF and WTO would find it possible to contribute towards the cost of the new consolidated ACC secretariat.
The Executive Director of UNFPA, in her capacity as Chairperson of the ad hoc meeting on the proposed High-Level Committee on Programmes, noted that there was a strong sense of common purpose and agreement at the meeting on the importance of such a Committee.
All participants had underscored the need for the proposed Committee to add value and, in that context, stressed that the subsidiary machinery should be carefully examined, streamlined and kept under continuous review to ensure that it remained effective, action-oriented, flexible and capable of ensuring timely responses.
For these reasons, the meeting recommended that the kind of subsidiary bodies/mechanisms required should be reviewed at the first meeting of the High-Level Committee in Programmes.
It was understood that while some of the existing subsidiary bodies may need to continue, in many other cases inter-agency work could be undertaken by ad hoc, time-bound task forces or through networks of technical experts rather than by standing mechanisms reporting to ACC.
The Chairperson further stressed the need to find ways to improve linkages between inter-agency work and the deliberations of intergovernmental bodies, and for greater “internalization” of the issues dealt within the ACC context throughout the organizations of the system and their staff.
She cited as illustrative areas of focus for the new Committee, inter alia, the consideration of selected issues relating to globalization; poverty; HIV/AIDS; integrated implementation of the goals of conferences and the Millennium Declaration; and collaboration with civil society.
The United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Management, in his capacity as Chairperson of the High-Level Consultative Committee on Administrative Questions, noted that there had been general agreement at the special meeting of the Committee that an effective High-Level Committee on Management, in addressing key administrative management issues, should focus in particular on developing system-wide responses to cross-cutting issues such as information and communication technologies and on common concerns such as procurement.
It should promote measurable improvements and, through dialogue and networking and taking advantage of synergies, bring greater coherence as well as savings to the system.
It should interact with relevant United Nations committees and provide a forum for exchanges with the Federation of International Civil Servants' Associations (FICSA) and the Coordinating Committee for International Staff Unions and Associations of the United Nations System (CCISUA).
He noted that in this area, as in the programme area, participants had agreed that the use of task forces rather than standing committees should be maximized.
Task forces should be composed of officials from specialized areas, have specific terms of reference, be time bound and be geared to achieving measurable results.
ACC endorsed the proposed functions and procedures for the two new High-Level Committees, as set out in the draft terms of reference submitted to it.
During the discussion a number of additional issues were highlighted.
ACC members stressed that participation in the Committees should be at the appropriate level if they are to fulfil their mandates effectively.
Appropriate ways of involving civil society and non-governmental organizations in their work should also be explored.
It was emphasized that both Committees should take into account and make use of work done in other relevant bodies, such as the United Nations Development Group, so as to avoid duplication and improve synergies.
It was stressed that the review of the subsidiary machinery to be undertaken by the two High-Level Committees, should be zero-based, that is, it should take as its starting point what needs to be done, rather than what was being done at present.
Permanent bodies should be kept to a minimum and their retention should be based on rigorous criteria.
It was observed that although the staff associations should continue to have access, if necessary, to ACC, ways and means needed to be explored to ensure a more meaningful dialogue with them through the High-Level Committee on Management.
In order to ensure coordination among the High-Level Committees, it was suggested that the Chairperson of the High-Level Committee on Programmes attend the meetings of the High-Level Committee on Management and vice versa.
ACC decided to establish the two High-Level Committees and requested them to report to ACC at its spring 2001 session, including on the results of their reviews of the subsidiary bodies.
The Committee also decided to establish a single jointly financed ACC secretariat as outlined in the note before it.
With regard to the Organizational Committee, the Secretary-General noted that there would continue to be a need, not necessarily for a Committee, but for a network of “focal points”, or “sherpas”, who could be consulted and could interact, on behalf of the Executive Heads, on all issues relating to the organization and agendas of the ACC sessions.
They would normally be the officials who accompany the Executive Heads at ACC sessions, and who could then be consulted on the preparation of the summary of ACC conclusions, ACC reports to the Economic and Social Council and other similar documents.
ACC endorsed this proposal and noted that the Secretary-General would communicate with Executive Heads on the designation of focal points for the exercise of the functions outlined above.
Executive Heads also concurred with the review team's proposal that ACC should be renamed, highlighting its function and composition as a board of chief executives of the United Nations system.
A. Briefing by the Secretary-General of the International Telecommunication Union on the preparations for the World Summit on the Information Society
The Secretary-General of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) informed ACC of the positive reaction from both the public and private sectors to the decision of the ITU Governing Body to convene the World Summit on the Information Society in 2003.
The Summit will address, among other issues, ways of bridging the digital divide and of building on major international initiatives to mobilize information and communication technologies for development, including the follow-up to the 2000 high-level segment of the Economic and Social Council.
He briefed ACC on the draft action plan and on the preparations for the Summit, noting that the lead time would provide opportunity for extensive regional consultations and the involvement of many actors in the process.
He proposed that the Summit be convened by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and indicated that the anticipated outcome of the Summit would be a declaration of universal political will and a concrete action programme for achieving the goals of the information society.
The Secretary-General of ITU expressed appreciation to the members of ACC for the support that several of them had already conveyed to him and their readiness to participate in the organization of the Summit.
Most concerned organizations had already confirmed their participation in the High-Level Organizing Committee.
The Committee should consider itself as a committee of “owners”.
Its work would mostly be carried out by means of electronic correspondence rather than through meetings.
Questions relating to funding and other resource issues will be the subject of early consultations by ITU with those involved in the preparations of the Summit.
ACC will be kept informed.
During the discussions, it was noted that in view of the fact that a number of other initiatives were under way in information and communication technologies-related areas, it would be important to share information on sectors being addressed and the donors being approached.
In this connection, it was noted that ITU proposed setting up a databank on information and communication technologies on a special web site and that this would help facilitate sharing of information and coordination among all parties involved, in particular organizations of the United Nations system.
ACC expressed its satisfaction with the draft plan of action and stressed the importance of an early decision by ITU on the venue of the Summit.
B. Briefing by the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations on the report of the Inter-Agency Task Force on the United Nations Response to Long-term Food Security, Agricultural Development and Related Aspects in the Horn of Africa
The Director-General of FAO presented the final report of the Inter-Agency Task Force on the United Nations Response to Long-term Food Security, Agricultural Development and Related Aspects in the Horn of Africa to ACC.
He underlined that the Horn of Africa is one of the most food insecure regions in the world, with around 45 per cent of the population undernourished.
The report of the Task Force examined the causes of food insecurity in the Horn of Africa, outlined elements for a strategy and a framework for action and proposed that Governments formulate country and regional food security programmes, building on existing initiatives.
The Secretary-General and ACC members thanked the Director-General for his leadership in this task.
The Committee welcomed the inclusive approach used during the preparation of the report, which involved Governments of the region and non-governmental organizations, as well as organizations of the United Nations system.
The report built upon the varied mandates and capacities of the different agencies concerned and recognized that many of the solutions to the problem of food security in the region, while relating predominantly to agriculture and rural development, would also depend on supportive action in other sectors.
ACC appreciated the analysis of the underlying causes of food insecurity contained in the report and endorsed its recommendations.
The Committee emphasized the need to ensure that the report should lead to concrete actions.
It was underlined that, in view of the substantial decline in Official Development Assistance to the region, no impact on food insecurity could be expected without substantial public investment.
The Secretary-General indicated to ACC that he would explore further the possibility of the World Bank taking the lead within a follow-up mechanism for the mobilization of resources to implement the strategy and programmes identified in the report.
Major bilateral agencies active in the region should also be brought into the process, and food security would need to be included in the poverty reduction strategies for the countries of the Horn of Africa.
The role of the Governments of the region, and of their regional organization, was recognized as crucial to the success of the United Nations response.
This would involve strong country ownership, as well as governmental commitment to the elimination of famine and food insecurity, including through the allocation of domestic resources and the formulation of relevant policies and programmes.
The United Nations country teams as well as the organizations of the United Nations system not represented at country level and non-governmental organizations would play important roles in supporting the Governments and regional organization and, as a first step, it was envisaged that they would meet to agree on modalities for moving the process forward.
C. Briefing by the Executive Director of the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention on the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the High-Level Political Signing Conference of the Convention
The Executive Director of the United Nations Drug Control Programme briefed ACC on the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the High-Level Political Signing Conference of the Convention in Palermo, Italy, from 12 to 15 December 2000.
The Convention contained articles criminalizing participation in an organized crime group, money laundering, corruption and the obstruction of justice.
It addresses such issues as mutual legal assistance, extradition, protection of witnesses and victims and law enforcement cooperation as well as prevention.
The Convention also envisaged the setting up of a special fund for the financing of technical assistance to further its implementation and to which Member States may contribute the proceeds confiscated from criminal activities.
The Convention would also set up an intergovernmental mechanism for its implementation.
The High-Level Political Signing Conference of the Convention brings together world leaders, high-level officials of Governments, renowned personalities and experts to celebrate the launching of the first-ever international instrument against transnational organized crime.
The Convention and the signing ceremony will serve to advance the objective of the Millennium Declaration, “to intensify efforts to fight transnational crime in all its dimensions”.
The subjects of the three additional protocols to the Convention also reflected areas specifically mentioned in the Declaration, namely, trafficking and smuggling in human beings and illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons.
In addition to the plenary, symposia and seminars have been organized to discuss matters related to the Convention and its protocols, with emphasis on follow-up activities to ensure their effective implementation.
The Executive Director invited all members of ACC to attend the Conference and to participate in its various activities.
ACC welcomed the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the High-Level Political Signing Conference of the Convention and underscored their importance in the international community's struggle to stem transnational organized crime.
It urged all ACC members to participate in the Conference and to extend their full support to the follow-up and implementation of the Convention.
D. Briefing by the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization on the outcome and follow-up to the World Education Forum
The Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) briefed ACC on the follow-up to, and implementation of, the Dakar Framework, adopted by the World Education Forum, held in Dakar in April 2000.
He gave a comprehensive account of the follow-up mechanisms and arrangements at the global, regional and, in particular, national levels, and other essential aspects of the plan of action for follow-up, especially the schedule of the working group on education for all (22-24 November 2000, Paris) and the high-level flexible group (April 2001).
He further briefed ACC on UNESCO's financing strategies to mobilize the needed resources, and on the extensive consultations under way with partners and potential donors at the multilateral and bilateral levels (United Nations system, Group of Eight, and the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), and indicated that he would share the relevant document with ACC members in the near future.
While emphasizing the role of national Governments of developing countries in the implementation of the Dakar outcome document, the Director-General stressed the vital role of the United Nations system and other partners in supporting the efforts of Governments.
To ensure an effective and coherent support by the United Nations system, the Director-General informed the Committee of his intention to seek ways and means of working closely with the United Nations Development Group at the global level and integrating Dakar in the programming and funding tools at the field level (common country assessments, the United Nations Development Assistance Framework and public-reduction strategy papers).
He hoped to continue to brief ACC on the implementation of the Dakar Framework.
ACC expressed appreciation for the briefing of the Director-General of UNESCO and invited its members to cooperate fully with UNESCO in the follow-up to the World Education Forum.
E. Briefing by the Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund on the preparatory work for the 2001 General Assembly special session on the follow-up to the World Summit for Children and for the special session of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS
The Executive Director of UNICEF briefed ACC on the General Assembly special session on children to be held from 19 to 21 September 2001.
The objectives of this special session and the preparations for it were briefly described, including Preparatory Committee meetings in January and June 2001 and regional meetings and other events.
The Executive Director indicated that Member States were being encouraged to include younger persons in their delegations.
ACC members were urged to participate in the special session and in the preparatory process leading up to the event.
The Executive Director of UNICEF, in her capacity as Chair of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) “Co-Sponsoring Committee” also briefed ACC on the General Assembly special session on HIV/AIDS to be held from 25 to 27 June 2001.
She noted the importance attached to this session by Member States and outlined the objectives of the session.
The preparatory process for this session would be similar to that used in preparing for the Millennium Assembly and Declaration and that would involve the establishment of a formal preparatory body.
UNAIDS was serving as the secretariat for the event and urging the active support and input of ACC members.
ACC thanked the Executive Director of UNICEF for her briefings and requested its members to contribute to ensuring the success of the special sessions of the General Assembly on follow-up to the World Summit for Children and on HIV/AIDS.
F. Briefing by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance to be held in South Africa, from 31 August to 7 September 2001
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights recalled ACC's conclusion, at its spring 2000 session, inviting concerned organizations of the system to participate actively in the preparatory process for the Conference.
In the context of the preparatory work for the Conference, the High Commissioner drew the attention of ACC members to five areas that required cooperation with and contributions from organizations of the system. These included: (a) a study on ways of improving coordination between the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and all United Nations bodies and the specialized agencies involved in the fight against racism; (b) devising strategies for overcoming obstacles to further progress against racial discrimination; (c) the involvement and active participation of United Nations bodies and the specialized agencies in the process of elaborating the draft Declaration and draft plan of action for the World Conference against Racism; (d) public relations and information activities for the Conference; and (e) regional preparatory processes for the Conference, including the formulation of recommendations based on experiences at the national and regional levels.
The High Commissioner noted that the upcoming World Conference against Racism provided a significant opportunity to address the serious lapses that exist in the international community's efforts to overcome racial discrimination and ethnic hatred.
It also represented both a challenge and an opportunity for cooperation throughout the United Nations system.
ACC welcomed the update provided by the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the preparations for the World Conference against Racism and invited all its members to continue to participate actively in the preparatory process and to contribute fully to ensuring that the Conference outcome was both significant and effective.
Under this item, ACC also took note of the information provided by the Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on the worldwide celebration of World Maritime Day at the end of September 2000, based on the theme “IMO: Building Maritime Partnership”.
The celebration had served to highlight the key role played by IMO in regulating global shipping standards, improving safety at sea and preventing and combating marine pollution from ships.
As to social impact, IMO played an important role in assisting developing countries improve their capacity to build strong maritime administration, manage more efficient ports, strengthen shipping-related activities and provide employment and career opportunities for thousands of nationals of developing countries.
Administrative matters
A. Staff security and safety
In introducing this item, the Deputy Secretary-General recalled that since the last meeting of ACC in Rome there had been three major deliberate attacks on the staff and premises of the United Nations system, resulting in the brutal murders of six staff members.
One of these attacks had, in addition to loss of life, involved the taking of hostages.
During the same period, in a major incident, 500 United Nations peacekeepers had been taken hostage.
Staff security thus remained a major concern for the United Nations system and had been the subject of two internal reviews as well as an external review.
These reviews had identified significant shortcomings at both the Headquarters and field levels, mainly due to shortages of resources and security staff.
Following these reviews, a comprehensive report had been submitted to the General Assembly (A/55/494), which highlighted these shortcomings and put forward proposals to strengthen the security management system and to ensure reliable and adequate funding to implement the measures required for enhancing staff security.
The relevant proposals included strengthening of the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator, providing funding under the regular budget for 100 field service officers and provision for training, communications and equipment.
The Secretary-General was also recommending the provision of enhanced stress counselling and the development of minimum operating security standards and threat assessments.
The cost of implementing these recommendations would be in the order of $30 million a year and, if approved by the General Assembly, would become effective under the budget for the biennium 2002-2003.
In the meantime, Member States were being requested to approve a number of transitional measures for 2001, including additional appropriations in the amount of $2.7 million under the regular budget.
The Deputy Secretary-General added that sustained attention and concerted action by United Nations agencies, funds and programmes were essential requirements to ensure that many of the proposals under consideration will have the desired impact.
She stressed that the deficiencies identified in the security management system will not be adequately remedied without a renewed, robust commitment by ACC members to ensure that all staff of the United Nations system, and especially representatives in the field, understand their responsibilities.
The ensuing discussion on staff security, in the light of the above presentation, took place in the presence of representatives of staff unions and the Chairman of the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC).
Other elements of the exchange between the representatives and the Chairman are outlined in paragraphs 68 to 71 below.
Noting that four of the recently murdered staff members were serving with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the High Commissioner for Refugees welcomed the report of the Secretary-General which, she noted, addressed all the main issues effectively.
She was concerned, however, that the transitional measures for financial support before the biennium 2002-2003 were not sufficient to cover needs over the next year. There was a need therefore to secure additional funding for 2001.
She also proposed the establishment of an advisory or support committee to the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator.
ACC members agreed that security and safety of staff was an issue that concerned all organizations of the system, whether they had field representation or not, and expressed full support for the proposals and actions outlined in the Secretary-General's report, including in particular measures for reinforcing the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator and strengthening field staff training and counselling.
In this connection, it was noted that the reinforcement of the Office of the Security Coordinator was essential but should not be a substitute for strengthening decision-making capacities in the field.
The locus of responsibility for security decisions could not be centralized and should remain in the field.
The crucial objective of reinforcing, through the Office of the Security Coordinator, the common framework within which such decisions were taken should be pursued in parallel with the strengthening of training and other measures at the field level, in a mutually reinforcing way.
In the same context, members of ACC agreed with the urgent need for stress counselling and concurred that no staff should be assigned to the field without security training.
ACC members also expressed concern that actions by Member States, in spite of declarations in different intergovernmental forums, did not reflect the necessary sense of urgency with regard to this issue.
The response of both donor countries and those in which humanitarian workers operated lagged behind and did not correspond to the seriousness of the situation.
Recalling that effective security required substantial resources, the United Nations Security Coordinator noted that the priority that Member States accord to staff security should be equal to the dangers inherent in the unique missions and duties that they call upon staff of the United Nations system to perform.
ACC decided to adopt the following statement:
The Administrative Committee on Coordination,
Deeply concerned about recent events which have resulted in the brutal deaths of six United Nations staff members over the past six months;
Also deeply concerned about the recent cases of detention of personnel;
Reiterates that the highest priority must be given to the security and safety of staff members;
Stresses the concerns and commitments made in its previous statements on safety and security of staff issued in 1998 and 1999;
Strongly supports the measures being proposed by the Secretary-General to Member States in his report on the security of staff (A/55/494) with a view to achieving a more stable and secure system of funding security expenditures and ensuring that adequate levels of staff are available at both the Headquarters and field levels to manage security, and urges Member States to provide the necessary financial resources within the United Nations budget and those of all United Nations organizations;
Reiterates the decision taken at its second regular session of 1999 that staff participation in security training programmes should be made mandatory and the Executive Heads pledge to implement this training across the board and to take appropriate measures to ensure that staff members, and especially field representatives of all organizations, attend;
Endorses the need to ensure that Minimum Operating Security Standards are in place at all duty stations;.
Reaffirms the commitment of Executive Heads to include the issue of staff security in their discussions with Member States, including bringing to justice the perpetrators of attacks on United Nations personnel;
Decides to keep the matter under continuing review.
B. Meeting with the Chairman of the International Civil Service Commission and staff representatives
The Committee met during the session with staff representatives and the Chairman of ICSC to pursue its dialogue with them on staff security, as outlined above, and to discuss administrative matters of common concern.
The Chairman of the ICSC noted that on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Commission, its twenty-sixth annual report included far-reaching recommendations aimed at strengthening the common system through the application of common personnel standards, methods and arrangements.
Among the recommendations, the most important were the proposals related to the development of an integrated framework for human resources management, which identified the elements of a modern and integrated plan for the management of human resources.
The Commission also intended to review the pay and benefits system starting at the end of 2000.
It was envisaged that this review would take at least two years to complete.
ACC would continue to be briefed on its progress. The Chairman also briefed the Committee on other issues, including standards of conduct for the international civil service, the establishment of grade equivalencies between the United States federal civil service and the United Nations system, post adjustment matters and conditions of service of the General Service and related categories and other locally recruited categories.
Executive Heads thanked the Chairman of ICSC for his statement.
They noted that the Commission's review of the pay and benefits system was timely and critical for United Nations system organizations that were finding it increasingly difficult to remain competitive in the international job market, particularly in highly specialized technical fields.
They further reiterated their strong support for the proposed review of ICSC, noting that it should proceed with the active participation of the Commission and all other stakeholders and should be perceived and approached as a positive initiative to reinforce the Commission and maximize its capacity to support the strengthening of the common system and the international civil service.
In their joint statement to the Committee, the presidents of FICSA and CCISUA focussed on issues related to safety and security of staff, HIV/AIDS, the reform of human resources management, the justice system and its administration as well as new trends in staff management relations.
They welcomed the report of the Secretary-General on the safety and security of United Nations personnel (A/55/494), but expressed the belief that the resources requested were modest given the scope and complexity of the actions to be taken to improve the situation.
They highlighted a number of issues such as the need for proper mission preparedness and planning and for the ratification of the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel (resolution 49/49) and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; the provision of alternatives to humanitarian assistance in areas where the situation on the ground eluded any control; arrangements to deal with non-state actors; the need to include locally recruited staff in all safety measures; and the importance of stress and grief counsellors to work with the families of the deceased.
With regard to HIV/AIDS, they proposed, inter alia, that a group of staff from all organizations of the United Nations system should be trained as focal points to help and assist those afflicted with the disease.
In the area of reform, the representatives highlighted the need to harmonize and make compatible the various reform initiatives being undertaken, expressed their concern at the recent trend in many organizations, as part of reform, to do away with permanent appointments and to replace them with shorter-term employment arrangements, and stressed the need to involve staff in reform processes.
In the latter context, they referred to an arrangement recently negotiated within ILO and invited ACC members to review and adopt it.
They also expressed the hope that ACC would safeguard, and possibly increase, participation and input of staff representatives and that the new High-Level Committee on Management would serve as an open forum for interaction between staff and administration.
Members of the Committee thanked the staff representatives for their statements and noted that, in the context of the review of ACC, methods were being explored to ensure a more substantial dialogue with staff representatives.
Interest was also expressed for the staff proposal to establish a network of HIV/AIDS counsellors.
The Director-General of ILO noted that the recently signed agreement with staff excluded issues covered by the common system from staff/management negotiation.
Also, where issues required additional resources, they would need to be presented to the Governing Board for approval.
A. International Strategy for Disaster Reduction
ACC, at its spring 2000 session, took note of the progress achieved in the implementation of General Assembly resolution 54/219 of 22 December 1999 on the successor arrangements to the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction.
It invited the Inter-Agency Task Force established pursuant to the resolution to give special emphasis to building and strengthening the capacities of disaster-prone countries through scientific research and training of experts.
Since then, the Inter-Agency Task Force has held two meetings and has established a number of working groups to address a wide range of issues.
In this connection, it was observed that the Task Force might give consideration to the proposed establishment of a working group on science and technology.
The point was also made that the development aspects of the International Strategy should be considered by the Second Committee, whereas the relief, emergency and humanitarian aspects should be addressed by the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly.
It was further observed that the secretariat for the International Strategy should maintain a distinct and multidisciplinary character under the joint ownership of ACC, and that genuine consultations needed to be held on issues of common interest to the concerned agencies, for example, the appointment of a director of the secretariat, knowledgeable and visionary about natural disaster reduction, and on the formulation of work plans of the Task Force.
ACC noted the progress achieved in implementing the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and took note with appreciation of the work accomplished by the Inter-Agency Task Force.
It requested the Task Force to continue to place particular emphasis on monitoring, prediction, early warning and preparedness in relation to natural disasters and on the prominent role of science and technology in its work.
ACC took note of the two guidance notes prepared at its request for the Resident Coordinator system, one entitled “Towards a multi-sector response to HIV/AIDS” and the other on “HIV/AIDS in the United Nations work place”.
ACC members expressed their thanks to those who contributed to the preparation of these papers and requested that they be transmitted to the field.
Other matters
ACC confirmed that its spring 2001 session will be held in Nairobi on 2 and 3 April 2001 at the invitation of the United Nations Environment Programme.
Tributes to the President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Executive Director of the United Nations Population Fund
ACC paid tribute to Mr. Fawzi Al-Sultan, President of IFAD, Mrs. Sadako Ogata, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and Dr. Nafis Sadik, Executive Director of UNFPA, whose terms in office would end before the next session of ACC.
ACC commended their outstanding leadership as heads of their respective organizations and cited their extraordinary achievements in multilateral cooperation at a time of historic change and challenges.
ACC expressed profound appreciation for their invaluable contributions to the work of the United Nations system and that of the Committee.

Geneva, 11-15 September 2000
Item 15 of the draft provisional agenda
Report of the Standing Committee of Experts on Mine Clearance
to the Second Meeting of the States Parties to the Convention
I. Introduction
The Standing Committee of Experts (SCE) on Mine Clearance, established in accordance with the decisions and recommendations of the 3-7 May 1999 First Meeting of States Parties (FMSP), met in Geneva from 13-15 September 1999 and from 27-29 March 2000.
At the FMSP, it was agreed in accordance with paragraph 25 of the final report of the FMSP and its annex IV that Mozambique and the United Kingdom would serve as Co-Chairs of the SCE, with the Netherlands and Peru serving as Co-Rapporteurs.
Representatives of 69 States, 8 United Nations bodies, the European Commission, the Organization of American States (OAS), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) and from numerous other relevant organizations were registered as participants in either or both of the two meetings.
The meetings of the SCE received administrative support from the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD). Matters reviewed by the SCE
The SCE considered progress in reviewing and revising international standards for humanitarian mine clearance.
The importance of involving all stakeholders and the need for the effective dissemination and implementation of the standards were discussed.
The SCE also considered the conditions necessary for establishing a conducive operating environment for mine clearance, and the desirability of agreeing to guidelines for this.
The SCE received progress reports on the Study on the Use of Socio-Economic Analysis in Planning and Evaluating Mine Action, which is being undertaken by the GICHD on
behalf of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), on the Level 1 Survey activities of the Survey Action Center (SAC), and on the impact of mine clearance on peacebuilding and reconstruction.
The SCE explored how better planning and the setting of priorities could be assisted by the availability of better quality information, both written portfolios of potential mine action projects and electronic information available on websites.
The UNMAS database, Mine Action Investments, was presented.
Ways of improving coordination among stakeholders were examined.
Options for improving internal coordination within mine-affected countries were discussed, and ways of better disseminating information internationally were proposed.
Recognizing the importance in most cases of developing a sustainable national capacity and the valuable role that the national military could play in certain circumstances, the SCE considered issues related to the use of the military and the improvement of training for enhanced management within national mine action centres.
Actions taken or in process on the development of specific tools and
instruments in order to assist the implementation of the Convention
With the active endorsement of the SCE, and on behalf of the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS), the GICHD is revising international standards for mine clearance, which will be known as the International Standards for Humanitarian Mine Action and contain a glossary of terms and terminology.
It was noted that members of the ICBL are reviewing and expanding existing guidelines and principles for good practice in mine clearance.
In response to a matter proposed by the first meeting of the SCE, Canada completed the task of developing the UNMAS database, Mine Action Investments, in such a way that donors are able to communicate information on their funding and policies underlying the provision of support for mine action.
The database is functioning, though further data would be welcomed.
The SCE commended the Portfolio of Mine Action Projects issued by UNMAS and the Compendium Document produced by Handicap International (HI)/Mine Advisory Group (MAG)/Norwegian People's Aid (NPA) as useful foundations for identifying worthwhile mine clearance projects to support.
UNMAS reported on the Information Management System for Mine Action (IMSMA), a planning tool for action in mine-affected countries which received widespread interest and support within the SCE.
With the encouragement of the SCE, the UN has developed guidelines for the use of local militaries in UN-supported mine action programs.
The SCE noted the ICBL website (www.icbl.org) and the suggestion that all stakeholders consider contributing to it, including through participation in “E-groups.”
The SCE noted that Landmine Monitor would issue its second report in time for the Second Meeting of States Parties (SMSP), and that further funding had been requested to complete the report.
implementation of the Convention
Based upon a statement made by Canada with respect to the compatibility between international standards for mine clearance and obligations under Article 5 of the Convention, the SCE agreed that Convention obligations and international mine clearance standards are not incompatible.
With the active encouragement of the SCE, the GICHD is undertaking on behalf of UNDP a Study on the Use of Socio-Economic Analysis in Planning and Evaluating Mine Action.
The Survey Action Center has embarked on a program of Level 1 Survey work in seven countries and has plans for undertaking more.
At the suggestion of the SCE, the UN agreed to consider making fuller use of the Steering Committee on Mine Action.
The SCE called for improved availability of news about mine action, in addition to Landmines magazine and the UNMAS website.
The second Landmine Monitor report would be available for the SMSP and consideration would be given to making available documentation from stakeholders (e.g., national plans and donor criteria) on websites.
With the active encouragement of the SCE and at the request of UNDP, Cranfield Mine Action is developing, with the support of the United Kingdom, curricula and training materials to improve the skills of mine action managers, and the first course for senior managers is being held from July-September 2000.
The SCE noted that subsequent courses would be run at the regional or national level, and would require donor support to assist participation.
The SCE commended Nicaragua's initiative in compiling information about national (internal) coordination mechanisms and related best practice, encouraged the continuation of this initiative and suggested that all stakeholders actively consider contributing to it.
UNMAS was asked to consider the possibility of more closely involving donors in the annual International Meeting of Mine Action Program Directors and Advisers.
V. Recommendations made by the SCE
The SCE recommended that all stakeholders contribute to the UNMAS/GICHD process of revising international standards for mine action and encouraged broad participation of mine-affected countries.
It was further recommended that UNMAS formally advise countries, through their missions in New York, of the opportunity to comment, with a view to UNMAS submitting these revised standards to the UN General Assembly (UNGA 55).
In addition, it was recommended that national authorities of mine-affected countries, donors and mine action agencies ensure that the new standards are applied.
The SCE recommended that consideration be given to the effective dissemination of revised international standards for mine action (including the translation of the standards) and to the Mine Action Support Group (MASG) playing an active role in disseminating these standards along with other good practice guidelines, like the Bad Honnef guidelines.
The SCE recommended continued discussions by the Committee on the process of reviewing and revising international standards for mine action, including the implications of applying the standards to the requirements of emergency demining.
The SCE recommended that the GICHD, when preparing guidelines for establishing a conducive operating environment for mine clearance, take into account comments and views made by committee participants, including by the ICBL Mine Action Working Group.
In commending the relevance of the Bad Honnef guidelines, the SCE recommended that HI, MAG and NPA review and expand existing guidance and principles for good practice in humanitarian mine action.
The SCE recommended that the UNDP/GICHD present preliminary findings of its study on the Use of Socio-Economic Analysis in Planning and Evaluating Mine Action to the SMSP and that linkages be further explored between the framework for monitoring and evaluating mine action, as outlined by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), and the UNDP/GICHD study.
In endorsing the work of the Survey Action Center in its continuing program of Level 1 Surveys, the SCE recommended that UNMAS/SAC disseminate survey findings and underlined the need for funding to enable additional surveys to take place.
The SCE recommended that donors indicate clearly their criteria and requirements for funding in order to help governments and mine action organizations seeking funding to provide proposals which are better tailored to meet donors' funding criteria.
The SCE recommended that UNMAS and HI/MAG/NPA consult when updating their respective project portfolios in order to make any appropriate linkages and avoid unnecessary duplication of effort; that each should identify points of contact; and that other NGOs should consider contributing to these documents.
Recognizing that the UNMAS database Mine Action Investments will be effective only if accurate and substantially complete, the SCE recommended that donors contribute full information and provide regular updates.
In addition, the SCE recommended that mine-affected countries check the database and notify UNMAS of any inconsistencies or gaps and that UNMAS consider the possibility of including information on private sector resources in the database.
The SCE recommended that UNMAS explore linking relevant countries' and organizations' websites and, if possible, consider incorporating information about mine affected States' national demining programs.
In addition, it was recommended that mine-affected countries provide texts for inclusion in the UN database or details of relevant websites for linkage to the UNMAS website.
The SCE recommended that UNMAS make more use of the InterAgency Steering Committee on Mine Action (which consists of the relevant UN organizations involved in mine action, the ICRC and the ICBL) and noted the suggestion that the Steering Committee consider possible participation by regional agencies.
The SCE recommended that the OAS and Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) share regional experiences in mine action with a view to enhancing coordination and mutual understanding.
The SCE recommended that UNMAS identify further ways of disseminating news on mine action, in addition to the regular publication of the Landmines Magazine and regular updates of its website.
The SCE recommended further consideration of the prospects for compiling guidelines based on lessons learned in emergency mine action in the event of natural disasters.
In addition, the SCE recommended that UNMAS, in the event of a crisis or emergency mine action response, provide to interested parties regular updates on the affected countries' mine situation.
The SCE recommended that the IDRC consider extending to other countries the Internet database which has been created for Mozambique .
In the light of its discussion on UNMAS guidelines on the use of the military in mine action, the SCE recommended (a) that the UN Inter-Agency Coordination Group on Mine Action review the way these guidelines are applied on a case-by-case basis; (b) that States Parties and donors consider the possibility of training military trainers of mine-affected countries; and (c) that non-UN mine action stakeholders apply the UN guidelines in all circumstances where the use of the military is an option.
The SCE recommended that donors and implementing agencies consider a multidisciplinary approach to mine action including, where appropriate, other mine action elements in addition to mine clearance, such as victim assistance and mine awareness education.
The SCE recommended that the phasing out of direct assistance to national capacities should begin at the appropriate time so as to reduce reliance on foreign assistance (e.g., the use of expatriate technical assistants) when adequate local capacities have been developed.
The SCE recommended that all relevant actors retain a flexible approach in following mine action guidelines and Committee recommendations.

Geneva, 11-15 September 2000
Item 15 of the draft provisional agenda
I. Introduction
The Standing Committee of Experts on Victim Assistance, Socio-Economic Reintegration and Mine Awareness (SCE-VA), established in accordance with the decisions and recommendations of the 3-7 May 1999 First Meeting of States Parties (FMSP), met in Geneva from 15-17 September 1999 and from 29-31 March 2000.
At the First Meeting of States Parties, it was agreed in accordance with paragraph 25 of the final report of the FMSP and its Annex IV that Mexico (Ambassador Antonio De Icaza) and Switzerland (Ambassador Erwin Hofer) would serve as Co-Chairs of the SCE-VA, with Japan (Mr. Kimura) and Nicaragua (Ms. Cecilia Sanchez) serving as Co-Rapporteurs.
Representatives of 43 States Parties, 9 States that signed but have not ratified the Convention, 9 other States, United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), United Nations Department for Disarmament Affairs (UNDDA), United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR), World Health Organization (WHO), Organization of American States (OAS), the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC), the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD) and from numerous other relevant organizations were registered as participants in the SCE-VA meetings.
The meetings of the SCE-VA received administrative support from the GICHD.
The final report of the Second Meeting SCE-VA containing background information, views, opinions, analysis and recommendations can be found at www.gichd.ch[1].
Its reading is highly recommended.
At the first SCE-VA meeting six “Network Groups” were established to facilitate work in the following thematic areas: Collection and Dissemination of Guidelines; Information and Data Collection; Victim Assistance Reporting; Mine/Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) Awareness; Portfolio of Victim Assistance Programs; and Donor Coordination.
The deliberations and outcomes of the Network Groups were discussed at the second meeting of the SCE-VA.
Based on a spirit of partnership, shared commitment, and responsibility between civil society and governments, the SCE-VA discussed a comprehensive and integrated approach to victim assistance.
The SCE-VA discussed a definition of “landmine victim” which includes directly affected individuals, their families, and mine-affected communities.
In addition, the SCE-VA discussed “victim assistance” as multi-faceted, and requiring a broad range of activities including prevention, emergency medical care, physical and psychological rehabilitation and socio-economic integration.
Also considered was victim assistance being defined as an integrated part of assistance to all victims of violence and trauma and persons with disabilities.
The SCE-VA discussed, with a view to guaranteeing a long-term sustainable solution, victim assistance being integrated in a broader context of post-conflict reconstruction and development strategies, without losing sight of the directly affected individuals, families and communities who are specifically targeted by the Convention.
In particular, the SCE-VA considered the need to have victim assistance integrated into public health, community development, conflict and violence prevention.
In addition, the SCE-VA considered the need to include measures relevant to meeting the needs of victims in the principles of humanitarian and development cooperation.
During the first meeting of the SCE-VA, Nicaragua and Mexico agreed to facilitate the Network Group on the Collection and Dissemination of Guidelines.
The main objective of the Network Group was to try to make existing victim assistance guidelines, including guidelines on socio-economic reintegration and mine awareness, available to all relevant actors.
To achieve this objective, the Network Group: called upon all interested actors to contribute in the collection of existing guidelines; collected all existing victim assistance guidelines received; discussed how to disseminate the received existing guidelines; and discussed the need to disseminate a list with the collected guidelines and relevant information to interested parties.
During the first meeting of the SCE-VA, Switzerland agreed to facilitate the Network Group on Information and Data Collection.
The Network Group discussed a more systematic and reliable data collection and dissemination.
Efforts were focused on base line data and quantifying the impact on public health and reintegration systems, on human and socio-economic development and on the daily life of people and communities.
The Network Group emphasized that acquiring victim data should not be an objective in itself but integrated into broader efforts to prevent injuries, assist victims and to facilitate better allocation of resources.
The Network Group raised issues like national ownership, capacity building, institutional development and adapting methodologies to reality in the mine-affected countries.
The Network Group discussed providing mine-affected countries with methodological support rather than solutions, data collection being handled sensitively, and taking into consideration the impact of data collection on victims.
During the first meeting of the SCE-VA, the ICBL and Handicap International agreed to facilitate the Network Group on Victim Assistance Reporting, the purpose of which was to propose a voluntary reporting mechanism.
The Network Group raised the issue that, while there is no explicit requirement in the Convention for countries to report on contributions to victim assistance and mine awareness, the Convention requires, in article 6, para.
3, that: “Each State Party in a position to do so shall provide assistance for the care and the rehabilitation, and social and economic reintegration, of mine victims and for mine awareness programmes.”
During the first meeting of the SCE-VA, the ICBL Working Group on Victim Assistance agreed to facilitate the Network Group on Portfolio of Victim Assistance Programs.
The Network Group noted that mention of victim assistance in the Convention has led to a global upsurge of interest in these programs and that to date there is no global compilation of information on programming.
During the first meeting of the SCE-VA, Sweden agreed to facilitate the Network Group on Donor Coordination.
The Network Group covered numerous issues of importance (e.g., recognizing that different states have different needs and understanding the need for both a comprehensive development approach to victim assistance and remembering that victims should not have to wait until macro-level problems are solved before they begin to enjoy a better quality of life) and identified several ideas for further consideration.
The SCE-VA identified that a strategic, comprehensive and integrated approach to victim assistance is needed and made specific progress in the following areas: (a) towards efficient and effective means to monitor Article 6 obligations; (b) in the development, refinement and implementation of various programming and coordination tools; (c) in promoting an information exchange and discussion of various tools for data collection and mine awareness; (d) in promoting various sets of victim assistance and mine awareness guidelines; and (e) in better understanding matters pertaining to victim assistance data collection.
The SCE-VA developed a Portfolio of Victim Assistance Programs, the purposes of which are: to raise awareness among governments, donors, and program implementers on the range of activities that constitute victim assistance; to promote transparency among all actors in victim assistance; to highlight needs which have not been addressed because of lack of resources; and, to facilitate contact and information sharing among actors in victim assistance.
Based upon the work of the Network Group on Victim Assistance Reporting, the SCE-VA recognized the importance of reporting by all States parties on support provided for victim assistance and agreed to continue work on effective and efficient means through which States parties could report on this matter.
V. Recommendations made by the SCE-VA
It was recommended that governments establish a mechanism or designate a focal point through which information on victim assistance guidelines could be channelled to appropriate actors in the field and to those elaborating victim assistance, socio-economic reintegration, mine awareness policies or programs.
It was further recommended that ways and means should be found to translate these guidelines into the languages of mine-affected countries.
It was recommended that the WHO give due attention to enhancing and assessing the quality and performance of surveillance systems for victim assistance in affected countries.
It was recommended that governments, international organizations, and NGOs share their information at country level with the local bodies (e.g., inter-sectoral committees, mine action centres, health authorities, etc.) and make the information public.
Governments of affected countries should be encouraged to establish victim assistance websites.
It was recommended that new incidents be covered by an adapted health information system producing simple and rapid information as well as by the Information Management System for Mine Action (IMSMA) and that further development of the IMSMA incident module be considered.
It was recommended that the WHO integrated surveillance system on victim and trauma be further developed and implemented in a gender disaggregated form.
It was recommended that a platform / clearinghouse for exchange, dissemination and information be established in order to promote transparency, in particular through: the collection and dissemination of standards, methodologies and questionnaires; the establishment of national platforms and linking them to the international level; the exchange of research; and, linking existing information about victims.
It was further recommended that the GICHD assume this task and develop a test module accessible on its website.
In addition, it was recommended that the WHO explore the possibility of engagement in this area.
It was recommended that the testing of various tools for victim assistance and mine awareness data collection be promoted.
It was recommended that funding be timely, particularly with regards to displaced and returning populations, responsive, appropriate to specific country needs and circumstances, flexible, allowing for the changing reality at the field level, as well as geographically appropriate and coordinated at the donor level.
It was recommended that the UNICEF International Guidelines for Mine Awareness be taken into consideration at the outset of programming.
It was further recommended that stake-holders should define, together with the mine action coordination body in the mine-affected country, the national standards and methodology for mine action.
It was recommended that guidelines be developed for monitoring and evaluating mine/ UXO awareness programming and training programs for mine awareness.
It was further recommended that mine/UXO awareness training be integrated into national mine action frameworks.
It was recommended that UNICEF continue to provide an open and transparent process ensuring wide participation among mine/UXO awareness actors.
It was recommended that UNMAS ensure the integration of the various mine action guidelines into the framework for the development of international standards for mine action.
It was recommended that mine/UXO awareness coordination must occur whenever possible under a government umbrella, on various levels, including between: (a) Different implementing agencies involved in mine/UXO awareness programming; (b) The wider mine action community including victim assistance organizations; and, (c) The “non mine action” humanitarian and development sector, which can bring alternative solutions to mine problems encountered by the communities.
It was recommended that mine awareness programs be implemented in partnership with national mine awareness institutions and actors at the community, regional, and national level, from program identification and assessment, to implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
It was further recommended that UNMAS be encouraged to develop a mine/UXO awareness function within the IMSMA to ensure the development of an integrated effective mine action plan and that mine/UXO awareness programming be responsive to both emergency and long term needs.
It was recommended that for the successful implementation of mine action programming donors/NGOs and all relevant stakeholders ensure that monitoring and evaluation are integral and meaningful parts of all programming.
It was recommended that key stakeholders ensure that agencies undertaking mine/UXO awareness activities have a knowledge of and commitment to the existing UNICEF International Guidelines and have ideally a proven capacity and track record of successful programming.
It was further recommended that existing mine/UXO awareness agencies should ensure that key documentation is widely available and accessible as learning tools for other agencies.
It was recommended that government officials involved in victim assistance receive a copy of the Portfolio as a tool to facilitate contact with other victim assistance actors.
It was recommended that states parties provide resources for the creation and maintenance of a national coordination body, under whose aegis would fall the development of a national Portfolio of Victim Programs.
It was recommended that interested parties continue to work together to develop suggestions and recommendations on methods pertaining to more effective donor coordination and long term resource mobilization with the aim of effectively meeting the immediate and ongoing needs of victims.
The focus of this process should be to identify gaps and available resources.
It was recommended that, in its future work, the SCE-VA pay due attention to the issues of: (a) coordination, with a focus on the clear and precise rationalization of the roles of the major actors in victim assistance; (b) identifying gaps in terms of financial, technical and other resources needed for victim assistance; and (c) measuring progress towards implementation of the Convention, particularly with a focus on examining victim assistance reporting mechanisms.
It was recommended that the future work of the SCE-VA should be divided into two types of activities: (a) operationalization of work already begun (e.g., following through on the most salient recommendations of the Network Groups; setting precise goals; and, collecting and disseminating documents from the SCE-VA); and, (b) analysis of new themes (e.g., creating an inventory of existing policies, studies, surveys and lessons learned; considering links between victim assistance and mine awareness and long-term strategies for sustainable development; and, increasing the participation in mine affected countries of civil society and, particularly, associations of mine victims and/or persons with disabilities.

Item 15 of the draft provisional agenda
Report of the Standing Committee of Experts on Stockpile Destruction
to the Second Meeting of the States Parties to the Convention
I. Introduction
The Standing Committee of Experts (SCE) on Stockpile Destruction, established in accordance with the decisions and recommendations of the 3-7 May 1999 First Meeting of the States Parties (FMSP), met in Geneva from 9-10 December 1999 and from 22-23 May 2000.
At the FMSP, it was agreed, in accordance with paragraph 25 of the final report of the FMSP and its annex IV, that Hungary and the Mali would serve as Co-Chairs of the SCE, with Malaysia and Slovakia serving as Co-Rapporteurs.
Representatives of 47 States, United Nations bodies, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) and numerous other relevant organizations were registered as participants in either or both of the two meetings.
The meetings of the SCE received administrative support from the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD).
The SCE solicited the views of delegations with respect to the following thematic areas: stockpile destruction as an integral part of mine action; allocation of resources - technologies and constraints; case studies; stockpile destruction as preventive mine action; cooperative structures for stockpile destruction; and the way ahead.
The SCE noted its appreciation of the work of the following moderators: Ret. Gen. Gordon M. Reay, Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Canada; Patrick Blagden, GICHD; Col. Paul Power, Australian Defense Forces; Steve Goose, Human Rights Watch; and, Adrian Wilkinson, Mine Action Consultant, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
The SCE considered a number of practical issues with a view to highlighting the importance of the core objective of the SCE, namely to facilitate a swift and dramatic reduction in the number of stockpiled anti-personnel mines globally, including the following:
ensuring political priority for stockpile destruction; obligations and rights of countries under Article 4 of the Convention; merits and constraints of various methods and technologies for destruction as experienced by individual countries; the role of the military and private sector in stockpile destruction; logistical, technical and financial considerations; possible alternatives to the current methods of stockpile destruction; planning and implementation of the process leading up to the actual destruction of stockpiles; merits and constraints of various methods of destruction as experienced by individual countries; financial and technical assistance - bilateral, multilateral and regional approaches to stockpile destruction; compilation of a database of industrial/research capacities and capabilities; possible mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating Article 7 reports; assessing overall progress with regard to stockpile destruction; progress report on global stockpiles and their destruction; flow of information on available technologies, costs and environmental impact; modalities of transfer and storage of foreign stockpiles; avoiding competition among the various branches and actors of mine action; planning and implementation of the process leading up to the actual destruction of stockpiles; engaging the media and the public at large in the process of stockpile destruction; need for accounting and certification procedures; compilation of databases on donors, recipients, needs, methods, options, companies, experts; and, possible mechanisms for engaging non-States parties in reducing their stockpiles.
It was expected that discussion on all the above matters would continue in the Convention's intersessional program.
As a result of the SCE's deliberations, it was accepted that stockpile destruction is an integral part, in effect the "fifth pillar", of mine action and that, accordingly, compliance with Article 4 obligations should receive high political priority.
It was also stressed, however, that this does not suggest unwarranted competition among the different branches of mine action.
At the FMSP, participants emphasized the need for the rapid universalization of, adherence to and compliance with the Convention and, in parallel, the importance of prompt and strict compliance with the obligations as stipulated in Article 4.
Accordingly, States were urged to comply with their reporting obligations under Article 7 as a way to facilitate future cooperation between prospective donor States and those requesting assistance in carrying out this important task.
In the course of its intersessional work, the Committee sought ways to ensure that the capabilities and capacities of prospective donor States become fully compatible with the needs of States requesting assistance.
In addition, the SCE reviewed a wide range of technical options for stockpile destruction, which was introduced in the course of the sessions for consideration.
A website related to stockpile destruction is expected to be introduced by the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) and Canada by September 2000 and States were encouraged to contribute to this effort.
Proposed UNDP guidelines on stockpile destruction will be made available on the web, as well.
A list of companies, experts and technologies related to stockpile destruction is also expected to be introduced in the near future.
A cumulative list of companies, experts and technologies could provide a necessary link between the "donor" and "recipient" countries when designing future cooperative structures.
Regarding monitoring and verification requirements, a number of presentations have already been prepared, which serve as good examples.
It was acknowledged that case study presentations are a useful tool for maintaining political enthusiasm and that a standardized format for the case study presentations could be identified vis-a-vis the ones that have been presented up to date.
The submission of (annual) national progress reports on stockpile destruction was not a matter of consensus at this point of time.
It was observed that there are a number of relevant questions not included in the Article 7 reporting format; therefore, a proposal for a separate questionnaire on stockpile destruction was entertained.
The important role the ICBL Landmine Monitor plays in reporting on the global stockpile destruction process and contributing to greater transparency on this issue was highly appreciated.
Actions taken or in process to assist in the implementation of the Convention
The need for additional resources to be secured for stockpile destruction projects was stressed.
To this end, the sessions considered various bilateral, multilateral and regional approaches as possible components for establishing cooperative structures for stockpile destruction projects.
The initiative launched by Canada and Ukraine was cited in this regard as a useful example for bilateral cooperation, while the establishment of a Partnership for Peace (PfP) Trust Fund for stockpile destruction within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) was singled out as a promising multilateral/regional project with a view to facilitating broad compliance with Article 4 obligations.
More than a dozen countries provided insights into their experience with stockpile destruction and representatives offered their respective views with regard to the merits and constraints of various methods of destruction as experienced by individual countries.
Financial, technical, social and environmental considerations were also discussed at length, and emphasis was placed on the need for careful planning and implementation of the process leading up to the actual destruction of stockpiles.
The importance of engaging the media and the public at large in the process of stockpile destruction was also highlighted by various delegations.
The SCE compared the converging or diverging approaches taken by the military and civil sectors in the actions needed for eliminating stockpiled anti-personnel mines.
In most cases, it was argued, stockpile destruction in military facilities leads to a substantial reduction of incurred expenses and entails the more efficient utilization of already existing resources.
Transparency in this process is also of critical importance, a fact about which the armed forces should be educated.
An important role should be assigned to players outside the military to ensure maximum transparency in the process of stockpile destruction (governmental agencies, mass media, diplomatic corps, etc.).
The possible roles of UNMAS and UNDP in stockpile destruction projects were also discussed.
With its 137 regional centres worldwide, the UNDP could facilitate various bilateral or multilateral arrangements with a view to promoting information exchange and technical/financial cooperation in this field.
The possible modalities of such UN involvement, e.g., transparency and lessons learned and shared, and financial assistance, were also discussed.
Retention of stockpiled anti-personnel mines for training and development purposes under Article 3 was also discussed at length, although the Co-Chairs made the determination that the issue should be referred to the Standing Committee of Experts on the General Status and Operation of the Convention for further deliberation.
Generally, it was agreed that examination of all options and factors should lead to the destruction of global stocks in the fastest, most cost-effective way and with the least harmful effects to the environment.
It was also emphasized that the possibility of adverse environmental impacts brought about by the destruction process should not be used as an excuse for inaction in meeting Article 4 obligations.
The Committee agreed that, at the Second Meeting of the States Parties, the urgency and importance of stockpile destruction should be affirmed.
V. Recommendations made by the SCE
It was recommended that those countries that have completed the destruction of their stockpiles should make their expertise available to those in need, because in many instances countries lack the technical experience, industrial capacities or know-how to carry out obligations stipulated in Article 4 of the Convention.
It was recommended that States be encouraged to contribute to the questionnaire presented by Canada in support of the development of an UNMAS website on stockpile destruction.
With regard to a complementary database to the Article 7 reports, it was recommended that the SCE Co-Chairs, in cooperation with interested parties, work to develop a questionnaire that would help collect information on needs and assistance offers expressed by non-States parties.
It was recommended that the SCE Co-Chairs develop specific language on recommendations concerning bilateral and multilateral/regional cooperative structures for stockpile destruction.
It was recommended that an examination of all options and factors should lead to the destruction of global stocks in the fastest, most cost-effective way and with the least harmful effects to the environment.
Geneva, 11-15 September 2000
Item 15 of the draft provisional agenda
I. Introduction
The Standing Committee of Experts on Technologies for Mine Action (SCETMA), established in accordance with the decisions and recommendations of the First Meeting of States Parties (FMSP), which was held from 3-7 May 1999 in Maputo, Mozambique, met in Geneva on 13-14 December 1999 and on 24-25 May 2000.
In accordance with paragraph 25 of the final report of the FMSP, it was agreed that Cambodia and France would serve as Co-Chairs of the SCE, with Germany and Yemen serving as Co-Rapporteurs.
Representatives of 34 States that have ratified the Convention, 7 States that signed but have not ratified the Convention, 9 other States, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) and 8 regional and international organizations, including the United Nations, and numerous other relevant organizations, including national mine action centres, universities, research centres and companies, were registered as participants in the SCE meetings.
The meetings of the SCE received administrative support from the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD).
The SCETMA benefited from a pragmatic and clear mandate as well as a lively and dedicated participation by experts whose diversity and complementarity found full expression in the course of the debates.
The SCETMA had been mandated to conduct a comparative survey of the needs of the end-users and of the technologies available to them or in development.
The Committee fulfilled its mandate by taking into account the constraints which stand in the way of providing end-users with appropriate technologies, as well as the new standards required by the technological progress of mine action.
This framework provided ample opportunity to field practitioners, program managers, specialists from Academia and research establishments as well as military and industrial decision-makers, to interact and to exchange information.
This provided a better understanding of the adequacy of technologies currently or soon to be available for mine action, of the new international standards that ought to be implemented, and of the most promising progress in technology research.
The Committee's work was enhanced by useful contributions by individuals responsible for mine action field work, including individuals from Mine Action Centres (e.g., C-MAC (Cambodia), CROMAC, IND-Mozambique, NCHD-Chad, Monitoring, Evaluation and Training Agency (META) and MAP-Afghanistan, CND-Nicaragua), international organizations (e.g., United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)) and non-governmental organizations (e.g., ICBL, Handicap International, Mine Advisory Group, Norwegian People's Aid, GICHD).
The military establishments of donor countries and affected States also participated.
The scientific sector (e.g., Mechem-South Africa) provided an overview of the ways used to attempt to adapt existing technologies.
End-users and the research and development actors, academics (e.g., University of Western Australia, Cranfield University, James Madison University, the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC)) discussed their own efforts at rationalizing mine action in the face of the diversity of hurdles it has to overcome.
The SCETMA confirmed that taken separately neither manual demining, nor mine detecting dogs, nor mechanical equipment, hold the key to the landmine problem.
The key lies in the so called "tool box" approach, wherein these techniques and technologies are complementary, and need to be used in different combinations after a careful review of the conditions and environment of each minefield or mine action program.
The SCETMA emphasized different elements of the "tool box" used by different Mine Action Centres, from Cambodia to Afghanistan, Mozambique, Chad, Nicaragua or Croatia.
The diverse elements presented reflect varying sets of constraints, ranging from human, geographical and climatic conditions, to financial, organizational or political limitations.
Mine Action Centres are well placed to give proper consideration, for instance, to the variety of mines in place in the same area, or to the demands made on the mobility and modularity of teams and equipment, in consideration of different conditions in the field, from waterlogged to arid soils, from sandy to rocky terrains, etc.
The SCETMA noted that while the tool box approach is widely accepted, there is room for a variety of opinions on other aspects of mine action in the field.
With respect to mine detection dogs (MDD) for example, the experience of deminers in Afghanistan shows that MDDs are fast and effective, provided they are assigned appropriate tasks in area reduction or clearance in low-density mined areas.
However, deminers in Kosovo pointed out that it is indispensable to adopt an accredition procedure in order to guarantee, before and during clearance operations, the quality of dogs supplied.
The University of Western Australia suggested "double blind tests" for dogs and supervisors.
Universal interest in the MDD tool, and lingering doubts on its proper use, have led UNMAS and the GICHD to launch no less than eight studies to cover every aspect of the MDD technique in the course of the next few years.
The SCETMA noted different, but not irreconcilable, approaches to the use of mechanical equipment.
Suppliers of heavy equipment stressed its effectiveness if assigned appropriate tasks, from road clearance to vegetation-cutting and other preparations of the field.
Practitioners in the field underlined the need for multi-purpose platforms and increased sustainability of the equipment purchased or leased, and for improved procedures for testing in the field.
All were in agreement on the necessity to integrate the selection of appropriate mechanical equipment in the early stages of planning for demining.
The SCETMA noted exposed concern at the multiplication of databases and information technologies available, and the need to promote compatibility and interconnectednesss.
Field workers insisted on the need to preserve an end-user friendly approach.
Progress made by the UNMAS Information Management System for Mine Action (IMSMA) was applauded - a system which between the two meetings of the SCETMA was developed and tested in a growing list of mine affected countries.
The SCETMA acknowledged the importance of the current exhaustive review of UN norms and standards.
End-users will systematically be associated with this process.
The new UN standards will also be compatible with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
However, concern was raised regarding the need to identify who will assume the responsibility for implementing these standards and verifying their correct implementation.
The SCETMA noted that stakeholders in mine action now realize that the time-lines of scientific innovation and progress and those of demining requirements are not necessarily the same.
It was undersand that states most active in research and development of new demining technologies do so primarily for military reasons, with less attention to the particular needs of humanitarian demining.
This bias, however, was not universal: international (International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)), regional (European Commission JRC), and national institutions do have specific programs or projects aimed at humanitarian demining.
All stakeholders agreed to stress the importance of a cooperative approach among researchers, developers, and deminers.
Actions taken or in process to assist in the implementation of the Convention
To faciliate the implementation of the Convention, the SCETMA concluded that there is an over-all need to nurture a dual approach in the field of mine action technology, namely: the development of simple, end-user friendly technologies based on improving existing material, as being essential to ease the burden of deminers and to speed up ongoing programs; and, the search for high-tech innovations, as being critical to save lives, time and money in the longer term.
V. Recommendations made by the SCE
With a view that cooperation between mine action stakeholders must be strengthened in several ways and at several levels, the SCETMA recommended:
Geneva, 11-15 September 2000
Item 11 of the draft provisional agenda
Report of the Standing Committee of Experts
I. Introduction
The Standing Committee of Experts (SCE) on the General Status and Operation of the Convention, established in accordance with the decisions and recommendations of the First Meeting of States Parties (FMSP), held from 3-7 May 1999 in Maputo, Mozambique, met in Geneva at the International Conference Centre on January 10 and 11, 2000, and at the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining on May 29 and 30, 2000.
In accordance with paragraph 25 of the final report of the FMSP and the Report's annex IV, it was agreed that Canada and South Africa would serve as Co-Chairs of the SCE, with Belgium and Zimbabwe serving as Co-Rapporteurs.
Representatives of 43 States that have ratified the Convention, 9 States that signed but have not ratified the Convention, 10 other States, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), 7 regional and international organizations, including the United Nations, and 13 non-governmental organizations were registered as participants in the meetings.
The Meeting received administrative support from the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD).
The Committee discussed the need to continue efforts in support of the universalization of the Convention and noted the continued growth in the number of states that have formally accepted the obligations of the Convention.
The ongoing work of a number of states to encourage universalization was noted, as were the efforts of various international organizations, the ICBL the ICRC.
The Committee discussed progress made in implementation of and compliance with Article 7 of the Convention.
While the rate of compliance with the Convention's transparency provisions, contained in Article 7, is not dramatically different relative to other Conventions, concern was raised that several states have not yet provided required reports.
The importance of timely, consistent and detailed reporting was highlighted and recommendations were made with respect to the reporting process.
The Committee discussed measures taken to implement Article 9 of the Convention, particularly the need to promote greater understanding of the different approaches taken with respect to national implementation measures.
In addition, the Committee heard concerns about only a limited number of States Parties having established legislation as part of the “appropriate legal, administrative and other measures, including the imposition of penal sanctions”, as required in terms of Article 9 of the Convention.
The Committee discussed matters pertaining to Article 2, particularly matters related to anti-handling devices and the sensitivity of anti-vehicle mines' fusing devices.
Ideas, like examining these issues through informal expert work and working towards the agreement by States Parties on an understanding on the matter were put forward.
There was no agreement on proceeding with either idea at this time, although an ICRC initiative to discuss these matters was welcomed.
Several States Parties affirmed their view (a) that mines equipped with anti-handling devices that activate when no attempt has been made to tamper with or otherwise intentionally disturb these mines are in fact anti-personnel mines as defined by the Convention and (b) that fusing mechanisms that cause anti-vehicle mines to function as anti-personnel mines are also anti-personnel mines as defined by the Convention.
The Committee received the views of the ICBL with respect to States Parties working towards a common understanding of which acts are and are not permitted under paragraph c of Article 1 of the Convention.
In particular the ICBL called for a common interpretation of the term “assist”, especially relating to the use of anti-personnel mines by non-States Parties in joint operations with States Parties and the stockpiling and transit of foreign-owned anti-personnel mines.
The Committee highlighted the need for greater understanding of matters pertaining to anti-personnel mines retained for training and development under Article 3 of the Convention.
To this end, the Committee received numerous reports from States Parties clarifying the reasons why mines are retained, how mines have been used to date and how they will be used in a manner consistent with Article 3 in the future.
The Committee heard the view that mines retained under Article 3 should be kept to a minimum.
The Committee received the views of the ICBL with respect to States Parties meeting their obligations under Article 6 of the Convention and, in particular, reviewed the need to provide support for victim assistance programs.
The Committee also reviewed the development and implementation of the UNMAS database of donor activity, Mine Action Investments.
The Committee discussed the relationship between UN standards for mine clearance and Article 5 of the Convention, concluding that there is no contradiction between the two.
The Committee discussed the need to examine matters pertaining to the operationalization of Article 8 in order that all structures and methodologies are in place for smooth execution whenever needed.
To this end, the Committee agreed to an ongoing action to further discuss these matters.
The Committee evaluated the Convention's first intersessional program and highlighted the need to make improvements, principally to streamline the process and address participation issues.
To this end, the Committee made numerous recommendations.
The Committee discussed a number of matters pertaining to preparations for the SMSP and recommended a draft agenda, a draft program, draft amendments to the FMSP rules of procedure, and draft provisional cost estimates.
The Committee also made a number of administrative decisions, including agreeing to the venue for the meeting and to a plan for documentation.
Tools and instruments developed or being developed to assist in the implementation of the Convention
With respect to Article 7, the Committee received an overview of the United Nations Department for Disarmament Affairs' Internet database of reports submitted under the Article.
While ideas to enhance the reporting process were heard, like moving to direct Internet-based reporting, the Committee recognized that immediate efforts with respect to Article 7 reporting should be focused on encouraging a higher rate of compliance and taking small measures to facilitate the process.
These small measures include States Parties, when possible, submitting reports electronically and, when submitting an annual update, to highlight the changes in relation to earlier reports.
Also with respect to Article 7, States Parties were invited to work with the ICBL on developing a reporting guide as a means of increasing the quantity and quality of the Article 7 reports.
With respect to Article 6, the Committee welcomed the UNMAS database Mine Action Investments, developed with the assistance of Canada, as a practical means for donors to share information on their activities for the purpose of enhanced coordination and greater transparency.
Donors were encouraged to enter data into the database before the SMSP in order to increase the usefulness of this tool and to allow for more substantial analysis of donor activity.
Monitoring participation in the database was considered a useful ongoing task for the Committee.
With respect to Article 9, States Parties were invited to work with the ICBL and other interested parties on developing a sample package of existing implementation legislation to assist other States Parties in establishing legislation.
A progress report should be made on this issue at the next SCE.
With respect to Article 5, based upon a statement made by Canada with respect to the compatibility between international standards for mine clearance and Convention obligations under Article 5 of the Convention, the SCE agreed that Convention obligations and international mine clearance standards are not incompatible.
With respect to Article 7, the Co-Chairs of the Committee agreed to continue to coordinate joint actions to encourage compliance with Article 7.
With respect to Article 2, the Committee welcomed as a useful step forward the offer of the ICRC to host technical discussions on how to minimize the risk of detonation of anti-handling devices through accidental or inadvertent contact and on sensitive fusing mechanisms for anti-vehicle mines.
The ICRC indicated that these discussions may be held in early 2001 and encouraged States Parties to prepare technical studies on these issues for discussion at that time.
Details on the proposed seminar will be provided at the next meeting of the Committee.
With respect to Article 8, based upon a paper developed by Canada and discussed at the Committee's second meeting, the Committee agreed that expert work should proceed in the lead-up to the first post-SMSP meeting of the Committee on elaborating upon “standards of evidence” which may be used as a basis for initiating a “Request for Clarification”, the maintenance of a list of experts, fact-finding missions and financial issues.
V. Recommendations made by the SCE
With respect to the post-SMSP intersessional program, the Committee made the following recommendations for consideration by States Parties at the SMSP:
a. Duration of Meetings: It was recommended that only three periods of meetings be held annually, including the Meeting of States Parties.
That is, each SCE shall meet twice between Meetings of States Parties, once during an initial week-long session of meetings in November or December 2000 and once during a week-long session of meetings in May 2001.
Mine Clearance and Related Technologies (meeting for 1.5 days during each of the two week-long sessions of meetings)
Victim Assistance, Socio-Economic Reintegration and Mine Awareness (meeting for 1.5 days during each of the two week-long sessions of meetings) Stockpile Destruction (meeting for 1 day during each of the two week-long sessions of meetings) General status and Operation of the Convention (meeting for 1 day during each of the two week-long sessions of meetings).
c. Language of Proceedings: To further enhance active participation in the work of the committees, it was recommended that States in a position to do so consider making voluntary contributions to have additional languages made available for the intersessional meeting.
e. Supporting Participation: It was recommended that consideration be given to developing a mechanism to provide for assistance to support participation in meetings of the Convention.
f. Role of Co-Chairs: It was recommended that committee co-chairs may, as appropriate, seek ongoing support and advice of past Co-Chairs.
g. Name Change: It was recommended that the Standing Committees of Experts (SCEs) be referred to as Standing Committees (SCs).
h. Post-SMSP Rapporteurs: It was recommended that the following states be nominated to serve as committee rapporteurs following the SMSP:
a. In order to provide States Parties with the opportunity to report voluntarily on matters pertaining to compliance and implementation not covered by the formal reporting requirements contained in Article 7, it was recommended that States Parties amend the Article 7 reporting format to include an additional form: “Form J: Other relevant matters”.
b. It was further recommended that States Parties consider using this form to report on activities undertaken with respect to Article 6, in particular to report on assistance provided for the care and rehabilitation, and social and economic reintegration, of mine victims.

Note by the Secretary-General
The Secretary-General has received notification of the resignation of David Etuket (Uganda), member of the Committee on Contributions.
Accordingly, the General Assembly will be required at its current session to appoint a person to fill the remainder of the term of office of Mr. Etuket, which expires on 31 December 2000.
Agenda item 17 (i) Appointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and other appointments: appointment of the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services
Appointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and other appointments: appointment of the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services
Note by the Secretary-General
In its resolution 48/218 B of 29 July 1994, the General Assembly decided to establish an Office of Internal Oversight Services under the authority of the Secretary-General, the head of which would be at the rank of Under-Secretary-General, and also decided that the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services:
(a) Should be an expert in the fields of accounting, auditing, financial analysis and investigations, management, law or public administration;
(b) Should be appointed by the Secretary-General, following consultations with Member States, and approved by the General Assembly.
For that purpose, the Secretary-General should appoint the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services with due regard for geographical rotation and in so doing should be guided by the provisions of paragraph 3 (e) of Assembly resolution 46/232 of 2 March 1992 whereby the Assembly had decided, in particular, that, as a general rule, no national of a Member State should succeed a national of that State in a senior post and that there should be no monopoly on senior posts by nationals of any State or group of States;
(c) Should serve for one fixed term of five years without possibility of renewal;
(d) Might be removed by the Secretary-General only for cause and with the approval of the General Assembly.
In light of the provisions of the resolution mentioned above, the Secretary-General proposes to appoint Mr. Dileep Nair (Singapore) as Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services for one fixed term of five years, effective 24 April 2000.
The Secretary-General trusts that the General Assembly will approve this appointment.

The Millennium Assembly of the United Nations
We the peoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century
Report of the Secretary-General
* Reissued for technical reasons.
Contents
The arrival of the new millennium is an occasion for celebration and reflection.
The world did celebrate as the clock struck midnight on New Year's Eve, in one time zone after another, from Kiribati and Fiji westward around the globe to Samoa.
Tokyo, Jakarta and New Delhi joined Sydney, Moscow, Paris, New York, Rio de Janeiro and hundreds of other cities in hosting millennial festivities.
Children's faces reflected the candlelight from Spitsbergen in Norway to Robben Island in South Africa.
For 24 hours the human family celebrated its unity through an unprecedented display of its rich diversity.
The Millennium Summit affords an opportunity for reflection.
The General Assembly convened this gathering of Heads of State and Government to address the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century.
Both the occasion and the subject require us to step back from today's headlines and take a broader, longer-term view — of the state of the world and the challenges it poses for this Organization.
They are better nourished, enjoy better health, are better educated, and on the whole face more favourable economic prospects.
There are also many things to deplore, and to correct.
The century just ended was disfigured, time and again, by ruthless conflict.
Grinding poverty and striking inequality persist within and among countries even amidst unprecedented wealth.
Diseases, old and new, threaten to undo painstaking progress.
Nature's life-sustaining services, on which our species depends for its survival, are being seriously disrupted and degraded by our own everyday activities.
The world's people look to their leaders, when they gather at the Millennium Summit, to identify and act on the major challenges ahead.
The United Nations can succeed in helping to meet those challenges only if all of us feel a renewed sense of mission about our common endeavour.
We need to remind ourselves why the United Nations exists — for what, and for whom.
We also need to ask ourselves what kind of United Nations the world's leaders are prepared to support, in deeds as well as words.
Clear answers are necessary to energize and focus the Organization's work in the decades ahead.
It is those answers that the Millennium Summit must provide.
Of course, the United Nations exists to serve its Member States.
It is the only body of its kind with universal membership and comprehensive scope, and encompassing so many areas of human endeavour.
These features make it a uniquely useful forum — for sharing information, conducting negotiations, elaborating norms and voicing expectations, coordinating the behaviour of states and other actors, and pursuing common plans of action.
We must ensure that the United Nations performs these functions as efficiently and effectively as possible.
The United Nations is more than a mere tool, however.
As its Charter makes clear, the United Nations was intended to introduce new principles into international relations, making a qualitative difference to their day-to-day conduct.
The Charter's very first Article defines our purposes: resolving disputes by peaceful means; devising cooperative solutions to economic, social, cultural and humanitarian problems; and broadly encouraging behaviour in conformity with the principles of justice and international law.
In other words, quite apart from whatever practical tasks the United Nations is asked to perform, it has the avowed purpose of transforming relations among states, and the methods by which the world's affairs are managed.
Nor is that all.
For even though the United Nations is an organization of states, the Charter is written in the name of “we the peoples”.
It reaffirms the dignity and worth of the human person, respect for human rights and the equal rights of men and women, and a commitment to social progress as measured by better standards of life, in freedom from want and fear alike.
Ultimately, then, the United Nations exists for, and must serve, the needs and hopes of people everywhere.
For its first 45 years, the United Nations lived in the grip of the cold war, prevented from fulfilling some of its core missions but discovering other critical tasks in that conflict's shadow.
For 10 years now, the United Nations has been buffeted by the tumultuous changes of the new era, doing good work in many instances but falling short in others.
Now, the Millennium Summit offers the world's leaders an unparalleled opportunity to reshape the United Nations well into the twenty-first century, enabling it to make a real and measurable difference to people's lives.
I respectfully submit the present report to Member States to facilitate their preparations for the Summit and to stimulate their subsequent deliberations at the Summit.
All these proposals are set in the context of globalization, which is transforming the world as we enter the twenty-first century.
In this new era, people's actions constantly — if often unwittingly — affect the lives of others living far away.
Globalization offers great opportunities, but at present its benefits are very unevenly distributed while its costs are borne by all.
Inclusive globalization must be built on the great enabling force of the market, but market forces alone will not achieve it.
It requires a broader effort to create a shared future, based upon our common humanity in all its diversity.
That in turn requires that we think afresh about how we manage our joint activities and our shared interests, for many challenges that we confront today are beyond the reach of any state to meet on its own.
At the national level we must govern better, and at the international level we must learn to govern better together.
Effective states are essential for both tasks, and their capacity for both needs strengthening.
We must also adapt international institutions, through which states govern together, to the realities of the new era.
We must form coalitions for change, often with partners well beyond the precincts of officialdom.
No shift in the way we think or act can be more critical than this: we must put people at the centre of everything we do.
No calling is more noble, and no responsibility greater, than that of enabling men, women and children, in cities and villages around the world, to make their lives better.
Only when that begins to happen will we know that globalization is indeed becoming inclusive, allowing everyone to share its opportunities.
Let the Millennium Summit signal the renewed commitment of Member States to their United Nations, by agreeing on our common vision.
Let the world's leaders prove their commitment by acting on it as soon as they return home.
Globalization and governance
In the early years of the United Nations, the General Assembly's timely adjournment could be predicted with precision: its absolute limit was fixed by the year's last voyage of the Queen Mary.
That world, clearly, was a very different place from today's.
Indeed, when the United Nations was founded two thirds of the current Members did not exist as sovereign states, their people still living under colonial rule.
The planet hosted a total population of fewer than 2.5 billion, compared to 6 billion today.
Trade barriers were high, trade flows minuscule and capital controls firmly in place.
Most big companies operated within a single country and produced for their home market.
The cost of transoceanic telephone calls was prohibitive for the average person and limited even business use to exceptional circumstances.
The annual output of steel was a prized symbol of national economic prowess.
The world's first computer had just been constructed; it filled a large room, bristled with 18,000 electron tubes and half a million solder joints, and had to be physically rewired for each new task.
Ecology was a subject confined to the study of biology, and references to cyberspace would not have been found even in science fiction.
We know how profoundly things have changed.
World exports have increased tenfold since 1950, even after adjusting for inflation, consistently growing faster than world GDP.
Foreign investment has risen more rapidly; sales by multinational firms exceed world exports by a growing margin, and transactions among corporate affiliates are a rapidly expanding segment of world trade.
Foreign exchange flows have soared to more than $1.5 trillion daily, up from $15 billion in 1973 when the regime of fixed exchange rates collapsed.
A recent transnational telecommunications takeover created a firm whose market value exceeds the GDP of nearly half of all United Nations Members, though it ranks only as the world's fourth most valuable company.
Globalization has been made possible by the progressive dismantling of barriers to trade and capital mobility, together with fundamental technological advances and steadily declining costs of transportation, communication and computing.
Its integrative logic seems inexorable, its momentum irresistible.
The benefits of globalization are plain to see: faster economic growth, higher living standards, accelerated innovation and diffusion of technology and management skills, new economic opportunities for individuals and countries alike.
Why, then, has globalization begun to generate a backlash, of which the events surrounding last November's World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle were but the most recent and highly visible manifestation?
They protest against its disparities.
First, the benefits and opportunities of globalization remain highly concentrated among a relatively small number of countries and are spread unevenly within them.
Second, in recent decades an imbalance has emerged between successful efforts to craft strong and well-enforced rules facilitating the expansion of global markets, while support for equally valid social objectives, be they labour standards, the environment, human rights or poverty reduction, has lagged behind.
More broadly, for many people globalization has come to mean greater vulnerability to unfamiliar and unpredictable forces that can bring on economic instability and social dislocation, sometimes at lightning speed.
There is mounting anxiety that the integrity of cultures and the sovereignty of states may be at stake.
Even in the most powerful countries, people wonder who is in charge, worry for their jobs and fear that their voices are drowned out in globalization's sweep.
Underlying these diverse expressions of concern is a single, powerful message: globalization must mean more than creating bigger markets.
The economic sphere cannot be separated from the more complex fabric of social and political life, and sent shooting off on its own trajectory.
To survive and thrive, a global economy must have a more solid foundation in shared values and institutional practices — it must advance broader, and more inclusive, social purposes.
This view was firmly embraced by the world's leaders who gathered in the waning days of the Second World War to rebuild a viable international order.
They knew fully how an earlier era of economic globalization, in some respects as economically interdependent as ours, eroded steadily before collapsing completely under the shock of 1914.
That global era rested on a political structure of imperialism, denying subject peoples and territories the right of self-rule.
Moreover, the major powers lacked adequate means for international political adjustment and peaceful change.
To stabilize the European balance of power, for example, those powers resorted to carving up the African continent.
In the economic sphere, the best they could do to achieve international financial stability was to hold levels of domestic economic activity hostage to shifts in their external balance of payments — contracting when in deficit, expanding when in surplus.
This practice became untenable once the franchise was extended to ordinary people and governments began to respond gradually — and at first grudgingly — to people's needs for steady jobs and stable prices.
From the 20 years' crisis between the wars, however, the architects of the post-1945 world learned how utterly destructive it was for countries to turn their backs altogether on economic interdependence.
Unrestrained economic nationalism and “beggar-my-neighbour” policies took root almost everywhere in the 1930s, spilling over into political revanchism, totalitarianism and militarism in some countries, isolationism in others.
The League of Nations was critically wounded from the start, and in the face of those forces it stood no chance.
Our predecessors, therefore, wisely chose a course of openness and cooperation.
They established the United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (later subsumed into the World Trade Organization) and a host of other organizations whose job it was to make the overall system work.
Some supported decolonization, though the struggle for independence, which the United Nations was proud to promote, took too many years and cost too many lives.
In the industrialized countries, domestic support for open markets was secured by constructing social safety nets and providing adjustment assistance to adversely affected groups and industries.
We benefit from that legacy still.
Here, however, is the crux of our problem today: while the post-war multilateral system made it possible for the new globalization to emerge and flourish, globalization, in turn, has progressively rendered its designs antiquated.
Simply put, our post-war institutions were built for an inter-national world, but we now live in a global world.
Responding effectively to this shift is the core institutional challenge for world leaders today.
The Millennium Summit can help show the way.
How far we have moved from a strictly international world is evidenced by the changed nature of threats to peace and security faced by the world's people today.
Technologies of mass destruction circulate in a netherworld of illicit markets, and terrorism casts shadows on stable rule.
We have not yet adapted our institutions to this new reality.
Much the same is true in the economic realm.
Here, the post-war institutional arrangements were premised on a world made up of separate national economies, engaged in external transactions, conducted at arms length.
Globalization contradicts each of these expectations.
It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the trade regime is under such stress — it increasingly deals with traditionally “domestic” matters rather than border barriers.
Nor are we surprised that calls for a new financial architecture are so insistent.
Globalization constrains the ability of industrialized countries to cushion the adverse domestic effects of further market opening.
Globalization has also created new vulnerabilities to old threats.
Criminal networks take advantage of the most advanced technologies to traffic around the world in drugs, arms, precious metals and stones — even people.
Indeed, these elements of “uncivil society” are constructing global conglomerates of illicit activities.
Diseases have shaped history for millennia, spread by traders, invaders and natural carriers.
But the most recent upsurge in the global transmission of pathogens, above all HIV/AIDS, has hit with a velocity and scope made possible only by open borders and unprecedented mobility.
Entirely new dimensions of globalization have emerged as well.
While transborder pollution has been on the international agenda for decades, once the cumulative effects of industrialization were understood to affect global climate change, the world entered — literally, became enveloped by — a wholly new context in which conventional institutional remedies fare poorly.
The revolution in global communications has created new expectations that humanitarian suffering will be alleviated and fundamental rights vindicated.
Neither governments nor international institutions have yet sorted out either the full implications of these expectations or how to meet them.
The communications revolution is being felt in other ways, too.
The Internet is the fastest growing instrument of communication in the history of civilization, and it may be the most rapidly disseminating tool of any kind ever.
The convergence of information technology, the Internet and e-commerce may well become as transformative as the industrial revolution.
They will continue to alter the world's economic landscape and reconfigure organizational structures.
They already make it possible to leapfrog existing barriers to development, as entrepreneurs from Bangalore to Guadalajara and São Paulo will testify, and the range of such opportunities can be vastly expanded.
Perhaps most important, these technologies enable people to be connected directly who otherwise might remain divided by distance, culture and economic stratification, potentially creating, thereby, a better understanding of who we, the peoples, are.
But none of these possibilities exists for those without access to the technology, either because the necessary infrastructure or capital is lacking, or because regulatory environments stand in the way.
And so the challenge is clear: if we are to capture the promises of globalization while managing its adverse effects, we must learn to govern better, and we must learn how better to govern together.
The Millennium Summit, therefore, takes place at a compelling moment, not merely in symbolic but also in practical terms.
C. Governing better together
What do we mean by “governance” when applied to the international realm?
What are some of its desirable attributes if our aim is to successfully manage the transition from an international to a global world?
In the minds of some, the term still conjures up images of world government, of centralized bureaucratic behemoths trampling on the rights of people and states.
Nothing is less desirable.
Weak states are one of the main impediments to effective governance today, at national and international levels alike.
For the good of their own people and for the sake of our common aims, we must help to strengthen the capacity of those states to govern, not undermine them further.
Moreover, the very notion of centralizing hierarchies is itself an anachronism in our fluid, highly dynamic and extensively networked world — an outmoded remnant of nineteenth century mindsets.
By the same token, states need to develop a deeper awareness of their dual role in our global world.
In addition to the separate responsibilities each state bears towards its own society, states are, collectively, the custodians of our common life on this planet — a life the citizens of all countries share.
Notwithstanding the institutional turmoil that is often associated with globalization, there exists no other entity that competes with or can substitute for the state.
Successfully managing globalization, therefore, requires — first and foremost — that states act in a manner consistent with their dual role.
This implies, in turn, that decision-making structures through which governance is exercised internationally must reflect the broad realities of our times.
The United Nations Security Council is an obvious case in point.
Based on the distribution of power and alignments in 1945, the composition of the Council today does not fully represent either the character or the needs of our globalized world.
The same holds in some major economic forums: all countries are consumers of globalization's effects; all must have a greater say in the process itself.
The unique role of the United Nations in the new global era derives from our universal membership and scope, and from the shared values embodied in our Charter.
It is our job to ensure that globalization provides benefits, not just for some, but for all; that peace and security hold, not only for a few, but for the many; that opportunities exist, not merely for the privileged, but for every human being everywhere.
More than ever, the United Nations is needed to broker differences among states in power, culture, size and interest, serving as the place where the cause of common humanity is articulated and advanced.
More than ever, a robust international legal order, together with the principles and practices of multilateralism, is needed to define the ground rules of an emerging global civilization within which there will be room for the world's rich diversity to express itself fully.
Better governance means greater participation, coupled with accountability.
Therefore, the international public domain — including the United Nations — must be opened up further to the participation of the many actors whose contributions are essential to managing the path of globalization. Depending on the issues at hand, this may include civil society organizations, the private sector, parliamentarians, local authorities, scientific associations, educational institutions and many others.
Global companies occupy a critical place in this new constellation.
They, more than anyone, have created the single economic space in which we live; their decisions have implications for the economic prospects of people and even nations around the world.
Their rights to operate globally have been greatly expanded by international agreements and national policies, but those rights must be accompanied by greater responsibilities — by the concept and practice of global corporate citizenship.
The marks of good citizenship may vary depending upon circumstances, but they will exhibit one common feature: the willingness by firms, wherever possible and appropriate, to pursue “good practices” as defined by the broader community, rather than taking advantage of the weaker regulatory systems or unequal bargaining positions of host countries.
The more integrated global context also demands a new degree of policy coherence, while important gaps must be filled.
The international financial architecture needs strengthening, as does the multilateral trade regime.
Greater consistency must be achieved among macroeconomic, trade, aid, financial and environmental policies, so that all support our common aim of expanding the benefits of globalization.
Conflict prevention, post-conflict peace-building, humanitarian assistance and development policies need to become more effectively integrated.
In short, it is exceedingly difficult to successfully navigate the transition to a more global world with incomplete and incompatible policy fragments.
Formal institutional arrangements may often lack the scope, speed and informational capacity to keep up with the rapidly changing global agenda.
Mobilizing the skills and other resources of diverse global actors, therefore, may increasingly involve forming loose and temporary global policy networks that cut across national, institutional and disciplinary lines.
The United Nations is well situated to nurture such informal “coalitions for change” across our various areas of responsibility.
Many of the networks can be virtual, overcoming, thereby, the usual constraints imposed by distance and time.
The essential role that formal governance structures must continue to play is normative: defining objectives, setting standards and monitoring compliance.
For the United Nations, success in meeting the challenges of globalization ultimately comes down to meeting the needs of peoples.
It is in their name that the Charter was written; realizing their aspirations remains our vision for the twenty-first century.
But who are we, the peoples?
And what are our common concerns?
Let us imagine, for a moment, that the world really is a “global village” — taking seriously the metaphor that is often invoked to depict global interdependence.
Say this village has 1,000 individuals, with all the characteristics of today's human race distributed in exactly the same proportions.
What would it look like?
What would we see as its main challenges?
Some 150 of the inhabitants live in an affluent area of the village, about 780 in poorer districts.
Another 70 or so live in a neighbourhood that is in transition.
The average income per person is $6,000 a year, and there are more middle income families than in the past.
But just 200 people dispose of 86 per cent of all the wealth, while nearly half of the villagers are eking out an existence on less than $2 per day.
Men outnumber women by a small margin, but women make up a majority of those who live in poverty.
Adult literacy has been increasing.
Still, some 220 villagers — two thirds of them women — are illiterate.
Of the 390 inhabitants under 20 years of age, three fourths live in the poorer districts, and many are looking desperately for jobs that do not exist.
Fewer than 60 people own a computer and only 24 have access to the Internet.
More than half have never made or received a telephone call.
Life expectancy in the affluent district is nearly 78 years, in the poorer areas 64 years — and in the very poorest neighbourhoods a mere 52 years.
Each marks an improvement over previous generations, but why do the poorest lag so far behind?
Because in their neighbourhoods there is a far higher incidence of infectious diseases and malnutrition, combined with an acute lack of access to safe water, sanitation, health care, adequate housing, education and work.
There is no predictable way to keep the peace in this village.
Some districts are relatively safe while others are wracked by organized violence.
The village has suffered a growing number of weather-related natural disasters in recent years, including unexpected and severe storms, as well as sudden swings from floods to droughts, while the average temperature is perceptibly warmer.
More and more evidence suggests that there is a connection between these two trends, and that warming is related to the kind of fuel, and the quantities of it, that the people and businesses are using.
Carbon emissions, the major cause of warming, have quadrupled in the last 50 years.
The village's water table is falling precipitously, and the livelihood of one sixth of the inhabitants is threatened by soil degradation in the surrounding countryside.
Who among us would not wonder how long a village in this state can survive without taking steps to ensure that all its inhabitants can live free from hunger and safe from violence, drinking clean water, breathing clean air, and knowing that their children will have real chances in life?
That is the question we have to face in our real world of 6 billion inhabitants.
Indeed, questions like it were raised by the civil society participants at hearings held by the United Nations regional commissions in preparation for the Millennium Assembly — in Addis Ababa, Beirut, Geneva, Tokyo and Santiago.
Similar sentiments were expressed last autumn in the largest survey of public opinion ever conducted — of 57,000 adults in 60 countries, spread across all six continents (see box 1).
Strikingly, the centrality of human rights to peoples' expectations about the future role of the United Nations was stressed both at the hearings and in the survey.
The current level of performance, especially of governments, was judged to be unsatisfactory.
The respondents in the Millennium Survey expressed equally strong views about the environment.
Fully two thirds of them, worldwide, said their governments had not done enough to protect the environment.
In only 5 countries out of 60 was the majority satisfied with the government's efforts in this respect; people in developing countries were among the most critical.
The hearings and the survey alike gave the United Nations a mixed overall assessment.
In the sampling of public opinion, governments received even lower ratings than the United Nations.
Even in the world's oldest democracies many citizens expressed deep dissatisfaction.
The United Nations global conferences in the 1990s, for example, laid a solid foundation of goals and action plans — in the areas of environment and development, human rights, women, children, social development, population, human settlements and food security.
At the national level, economic restructuring and political reforms are more widespread today than ever.
The world's people are nevertheless telling us that our past achievements are not enough, given the scale of the challenges we face.
We must do more, and we must do it better.
The challenges I highlight below are not exhaustive.
I have focused on strategic priority areas where, in my view, we can and must make a real difference to help people lead better lives.
The challenges are clustered into three broad categories.
Two are founding aims of the United Nations whose achievement eludes us still: freedom from want, and freedom from fear.
No one dreamed, when the Charter was written, that the third — leaving to successor generations an environmentally sustainable future —would emerge as one of the most daunting challenges of all.
In the past half-century the world has made unprecedented economic gains.
Countries that a mere generation ago were struggling with underdevelopment are now vibrant centres of global economic activity and domestic well-being.
In just two decades, 15 countries, whose combined populations exceed 1.6 billion, have halved the proportion of their citizens living in extreme poverty.
Asia has made an astounding recovery from the financial crisis of 1997-1998, demonstrating the staying power of its economies — though Asia's poor have not yet regained lost ground.
Chief among the human development success stories since the 1960s are the increase in life expectancy in developing countries, from 46 to 64 years; the halving of infant mortality rates; an increase of more than 80 per cent in the proportion of children enrolled in primary school; and the doubling of access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation.
Approximately 1.2 billion people —500 million in South Asia and 300 million in Africa — struggle on less than $1 (see fig.1; for other measures of poverty, see fig. 2). People living in Africa south of the Sahara are almost as poor today as they were 20 years ago.
With that kind of deprivation comes pain, powerlessness, despair and lack of fundamental freedom — all of which, in turn, perpetuate poverty.
Of a total world labour force of some 3 billion, 140 million workers are out of work altogether, and a quarter to a third are underemployed.
The persistence of income inequality over the past decade is also troubling.
Globally, the 1 billion people living in developed countries earn 60 per cent of the world's income, while the 3.5 billion people in low-income countries earn less than 20 per cent.
Many countries have experienced growing internal inequality, including some of those in transition from communism.
In the developing world, income gaps are most pronounced in Latin America, followed closely by sub-Saharan Africa.
For example, poor countries — especially those with significant inequality between ethnic and religious communities — are far more likely to be embroiled in conflicts than rich ones.
Most of these conflicts are internal, but they almost invariably create problems for neighbours or generate a need for humanitarian assistance.
Unless we redouble and concert our efforts, poverty and inequality may get worse still.
World population recently reached 6 billion.
It took only 12 years to add the last billion, the shortest such span in history.
By 2025, we can expect a further 2 billion —almost all in developing countries, and most of them in the poorest (see fig. 3). We must act now.
I further urge that no effort be spared to reach this target by that date in every region, and in every country.
History will judge political leaders in the developing countries by what they did to eradicate the extreme poverty of their people — by whether they enabled their people to board the train of a transforming global economy, and made sure that everyone had at least standing room, if not a comfortable seat.
By the same token, history will judge the rest of us by what we did to help the world's poor board that train in good order.
There is a growing consensus on what must be done for us to reach this paramount goal — and it can be reached.
I wish to highlight a number of specific areas for particular attention by the Summit.
A. Achieving sustained growth
Our only hope of significantly reducing poverty is to achieve sustained and broad-based income growth.
South Asia, and even more so sub-Saharan Africa, will have to make significant gains.
A closer look reveals that this is due almost entirely to progress in East Asia, notably China, where poverty reduction is closely associated with strong rates of growth.
Indeed, recent studies show an almost perfect correlation between growth and poverty reduction in poor countries — a 1 per cent increase in GDP brings a corresponding increase in the incomes of the poorest 20 per cent of the population.
Only in the societies with the greatest inequalities does growth fail to benefit the poor.
So what are some of the critical ingredients of success?
Expanding access to the opportunities of globalization is one.
Those countries that have achieved higher growth are those that have successfully integrated into the global economy and attracted foreign investment.
Over the past 25 years, Asia has grown at an annual rate of 7 per cent and Latin America at 5 per cent.
Some people fear that globalization makes inequality worse.
The relationship between the two is complex.
With the exception of the economies in transition, recent increases in income gaps are largely the result of technological changes that favour higher skilled workers over less skilled ones.
As the economic benefits of education and skills increase, so does income inequality between the people who have them and those who do not.
This is true both within and among countries.
Globalization may exacerbate these differences, but it does not cause them.
Increased global competition may also restrain income gains in relatively higher wage countries, though to date this effect has been felt mainly in the industrialized countries.
Another major source of income inequality within countries is gender discrimination in wages, property rights and access to education.
Here globalization, on the whole, may be having some positive effects.
In the developing countries, the labour force engaged in global production typically includes a large proportion of women — whether in textiles, electronics, data processing or chip manufacturing.
In many cases, these women work in conditions and for wages that are appalling, and which we must strive to improve.
But the fact of their employment also has important benefits.
These new employment opportunities enable women to expand the range of critical choices open to them.
They can delay marriage, for example, as a result of which fertility rates often decline.
They and their children often gain access to more and better nutrition, health care and education.
As the survival rates of their children increase, fertility rates will decline further.
The increase in female employment and earnings may also lead to changes in the perceived “social value” of a female child, which means that parents and society at large may become more willing to give girls greater access to education, health care and nutrition.
It is now widely accepted that economic success depends in considerable measure on the quality of governance a country enjoys.
Good governance comprises the rule of law, effective State institutions, transparency and accountability in the management of public affairs, respect for human rights, and the participation of all citizens in the decisions that affect their lives.
While there may be debates about the most appropriate forms they should take, there can be no disputing the importance of these principles.
A fair and transparent public expenditure and taxation system is another key ingredient.
Revenues must be used wisely to help the poor, and to make sound investments in physical and social infrastructure for all.
Excessive regulation, by contrast, impedes economic performance and slows growth.
Certain practices clearly do not constitute good governance by any definition.
If a succession of military dictators in a resource-rich country in a poor part of the world siphon off as much as $27 billion of the public's money, economic performance and the poor are likely to suffer.
Those responsible for such abuses, and the international banks that eagerly transfer their funds to safe havens, must be held accountable.
Other forms of institutionalized corruption are far less extreme but may, nevertheless, seriously distort economic incentives, limit economic growth and result in low levels of support for the poor.
Nothing is more inimical to pro-growth, anti-poverty objectives than armed conflict.
It must pain us all beyond description to see a war between two of Africa's poorest countries drag on into yet a third year, having already taken an estimated 55,000 lives, and with 8 million people in one of the countries threatened by famine.
Internal conflicts in other parts of Africa have lasted even longer, and have destroyed the lives and livelihoods of many more millions of Africans.
Better-educated and healthier people are empowered to make better choices and lead fuller lives, which also makes them more productive and their economies more competitive.
Similarly, all the evidence indicates that extending equal opportunities to women and girls has multiplier effects for entire families and even communities.
As a supplement to universal social programmes, school lunches and other targeted initiatives for the poor have an economic as well as a social purpose.
Finally, appropriate levels and types of support from the global community — public and private — are needed for development targets to be reached.
I shall address this dimension of the challenge separately.
In short, experience confirms some fundamental truths: growth is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for reducing poverty and income inequality.
B. Generating opportunities for the young
More than 1 billion people today are between the ages of 15 and 24; in fact, nearly 40 per cent of the world's population is below the age of 20.
Many of these young people already are, or are about to start, having children of their own.
Most of the resulting youth bulge — nearly 98 per cent — will occur in the developing world.
Demography is not destiny, but this is a formidable challenge — not so much because of the sheer number of people as because of the context of poverty and deprivation in which they will have to live unless we take decisive action now.
If I had one wish for the new millennium, it would be that we treat this challenge as an opportunity for all, not a lottery in which most of us will lose.
Young people are a source of creativity, energy and initiative, of dynamism and social renewal.
They learn quickly and adapt readily.
Given the chance to go to school and find work, they will contribute hugely to economic development and social progress.
Were we to fail to give them these opportunities, at best we would be complicit in an unforgivable waste of human potential.
At worst, we would be contributing to all the evils of youth without hope: loss of morale, and lives that are socially unproductive and potentially destructive — of the individuals themselves, their communities and even fragile democracies.
Education
Education is the key to the new global economy, from primary school on up to life-long learning.
It is central to development, social progress and human freedom.
Educational levels in developing countries have climbed dramatically in the past half-century.
Indeed, East Asia's rapid reduction of poverty has had a great deal to do with its investments in education.
But we still have a long way to go.
While a majority of the world's children are attending school, more than 130 million primary-school-age children in developing countries are not — of whom more than half live in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria and Ethiopia.
Moreover, to enable families living in poverty to survive, a quarter of a billion children aged 14 and under, both in and out of school, now work, often in hazardous or unhealthy conditions.
They toil in urban sweatshops; on farms or as domestic servants; selling gum or cleaning shoes in urban streets; clambering down dangerous mine shafts; and — in distressing numbers — bonded or sold into sexual services.
Having approved the International Labour Organization convention on the worst forms of child labour, Member States must now implement it fully. Providing primary education for the 130 million children in developing countries who do not now enjoy it would add an estimated $7 billion a year to educational costs, over a 10-year period.
More than buildings are required, however.
Schools must be accessible, have qualified teachers and offer such amenities as textbooks and supplies for the poor.
About 60 per cent of children not in school are girls.
Female enrolment in rural areas remains shockingly low.
Short-changing girls is not only a matter of gender discrimination; it is bad economics and bad social policy.
Experience has shown, over and over again, that investments in girls' education translate directly and quickly into better nutrition for the whole family, better health care, declining fertility, poverty reduction and better overall economic performance.
Indeed, world leaders, at United Nations conferences throughout the 1990s, have acknowledged that poverty cannot be overcome without specific, immediate and sustained attention to girls' education.
Yet the gap between numbers of boys and girls in school remains significant in 47 countries even at the primary level.
Schooling is often expensive, girls are a traditional source of free household labour and parents are not confident that an educated daughter will benefit the family as much as an educated son.
To overcome this difference between household priorities and those of society at large, families need support from their local communities and governments, backed by the wider world.
Generating employment opportunities for women would have a similar effect.
Universal access to primary and secondary school education is vital, and can only be achieved by closing the education gender gap.
UNICEF, with other United Nations partners, has developed an initiative that encompasses both primary and secondary levels.
Its success depends both on national strategies and plans and on international financial support.
I urge the Millennium Summit to endorse the objectives of demonstrably narrowing the gender gap in primary and secondary education by 2005 and of ensuring that, by 2015 all children complete a full course of primary education.
The world faces a major challenge of youth unemployment — and it is liable to get even worse with the coming youth bulge.
According to International Labour Organization estimates, 60 million young people are searching for work but cannot find any; about 80 per cent of them are in developing countries and economies in transition.
Those in the 15 to 24 age cohort are nearly twice as likely to be unemployed as adults; in some developing countries the ratio is higher.
Young workers are also more likely than older ones to be last hired, first fired; and they are less likely to be protected by legislation.
Joblessness among the young can be devastating, and governments have tried, in a number of ways, to deal with it.
But policies targeted at young people, including preferential hiring, have proved largely unsuccessful for the simple reason that they are economically unsustainable.
The problem is one of inadequate aggregate demand.
No one has yet discovered any easy or obvious solutions to this self-perpetuating cycle.
Together with the heads of the World Bank and the International Labour Organization, I am convening a high-level policy network on youth employment — drawing on the most creative leaders in private industry, civil society and economic policy to explore imaginative approaches to this difficult challenge.
I will ask this policy network to propose a set of recommendations that I can convey to world leaders within a year.
The possible sources of solutions will include the Internet and the informal sector, especially the contribution that small enterprises can make to employment generation.
C. Promoting health and combating HIV/AIDS
In recent decades, innovations in medicine, progress in basic health care and enabling social policies have brought dramatic increases in life expectancy and sharp declines in infant mortality.
Better health, in turn, stimulates economic growth while reducing poverty and income inequality.
In fact, investments in health care are particularly beneficial to the poor, who are largely dependent for their livelihoods on their own labour.
Not all regions have achieved the same level of progress.
East Asia has done best, sub-Saharan Africa the least well.
Lack of access to basic health care is one of the main reasons poor people stay poor.
In most low-income countries, health spending is often less than $10 per person per year.
In Africa, the high burden of disease not only requires families to stretch their meagre resources but also locks them into a high-fertility, high-mortality poverty trap.
In some of the transition economies, a precipitous fall in life expectancy has occurred in recent years, reflecting reduced public spending on health care and a more general erosion of social services.
Although more than $56 billion a year is spent globally on health research, less than 10 per cent is aimed at the health problems affecting 90 per cent of the world's population.
Pneumonia, diarrhoea, tuberculosis and malaria — all of great concern to developing countries — receive less than 1 per cent of global health research budgets.
The results are shattering.
Malaria alone takes two lives every minute of every day — mainly children under 5 and pregnant women.
The Roll Back Malaria campaign, led by the World Health Organization, deserves full support as it seeks to control and prevent this deadly disease.
I wish here to focus on a specific health crisis that threatens to reverse a generation of accomplishments in human development, and which is rapidly becoming a social crisis on a global scale: the spread of HIV/AIDS.
Some 50 million people have been infected with HIV since the early 1970s; 16 million have died.
In 1999 alone, 5.6 million people became infected with HIV, half of them under 25 years old.
It is a disease that attacks the young disproportionately, its worst effects are concentrated in poor countries and it has a hideous potential to expand.
Of nearly 36 million people now living with HIV/AIDS worldwide, more than 23 million are in sub-Saharan Africa.
In Côte d'Ivoire, a teacher dies of AIDS every school day.
The average child born in Botswana today has a life expectancy of 41 years, when without AIDS it would have been 70 years.
In the worst hit cities of southern Africa, 40 per cent of pregnant women are HIV-positive.
In that same region, more than one child in every 10 has already lost its mother to AIDS.
By 2010, it is estimated that there will be 40 million orphans in sub-Saharan Africa, largely because of HIV/AIDS.
Those children are far less likely to continue schooling or be immunized than their peers, and much more likely to suffer serious malnutrition.
Tragically, it is no longer unusual to see orphans under the age of 15 heading households.
Government projections in Zimbabwe indicate that HIV/AIDS will consume 60 per cent of the nation's health budget by 2005, and even that will be wholly inadequate.
AIDS is decimating the ranks of the skilled and educated during their prime years, with what are bound to be tragic implications for every affected country and for the entire region.
In Asia, new HIV infections increased by 70 per cent between 1996 and 1998.
India is now estimated to have more people living with HIV than any other country in the world.
In short, the crisis has become global.
Building on the agreement reached by the General Assembly at its special session on population and development, held in 1999, I propose a strategy to contain and reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS, focused on young men and women between the ages of 15 and 24, and to provide better care for those living with the illness.
The active support of governments is critical.
In too many countries an official conspiracy of silence about AIDS has denied people information that could have saved their lives.
We must empower young people to protect themselves through information and a supportive social environment that reduces their vulnerability to infection.
As a next step, ready access to essential services and preventive technologies must be provided, including male and female condoms.
Preventing mother-to-child transmission is especially important.
A $4 single dose — along with the cost of testing and voluntary counselling — may be nearly as effective as more complicated and far more expensive regimens.
The world's leaders must act to protect their young people and children from avoidable premature illness and mortality due to HIV.
UNAIDS will work with governments and other partners to develop and implement national plans of action.
Indeed, I would urge that every seriously affected country have a national plan of action in place within one year of the Summit. In addition:
I recommend that the Millennium Summit adopt as an explicit goal the reduction of HIV infection rates in persons 15 to 24 years of age — by 25 per cent within the most affected countries before the year 2005 and by 25 per cent globally before 2010.
To that end, I recommend further that governments set explicit prevention targets: by 2005 at least 90 per cent, and by 2010 at least 95 per cent, of young men and women must have access to the information, education and services they need to protect themselves against HIV infection.
Finally, the world desperately needs a vaccine against HIV.
Of the $2 billion spent on research for the treatment of AIDS to date, only $250 million has been spent on creating vaccines, few of which are potentially useful for poor countries, where about 95 per cent of HIV infections occur.
Therefore, I challenge the developed countries to work with their pharmaceutical industries and other partners to develop an effective and affordable vaccine against HIV.
The scientific challenges and financial needs are daunting, but I believe that innovative public-private partnerships, supported by public incentive systems, can stimulate the increased investments so desperately needed.
The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization serves as a model of what such partnerships can achieve (see box 2).
Finally, we must also ensure that systems of care and support for the 36 million people who live with HIV/AIDS are improved.
Even relatively inexpensive treatments and better care can help in the fight against the symptoms of AIDS, and can make it possible for people with AIDS to live longer, more productive and more dignified lives.
Moreover, governments, the pharmaceutical industry and international institutions working together must make HIV-related drugs more widely accessible to developing countries.
D. Upgrading the slums
During the next generation, the global urban population will double, from 2.5 billion to 5 billion people.
Almost all of the increase will be in developing countries.
Cities are often described as cradles of civilization, and sources of cultural and economic renaissance but, for the roughly one third of the developing world's urban population that lives in extreme poverty, they are anything but that.
Most of these urban poor have no option but to find housing in squalid and unsafe squatter settlements or slums.
And even though the population of cities, like countries, has on average become older, slum dwellers are getting younger.
Slums go by various names — favelas, kampungs, bidonvilles, tugurios, gecikondus — but the meaning is everywhere the same: miserable living conditions.
Slums lack basic municipal services, such as water, sanitation, waste collection and storm drainage.
Typically, there are no schools or clinics within easy reach, no places for the community to meet and socialize, no safe areas for children to play.
Slum dwellers live and work in conditions of pervasive insecurity — exposed to disease, crime and environmental hazards.
Such slums and squatter settlements are only partially caused by inherent resource scarcities.
Also to blame are poorly functioning markets for property and land, unresponsive financial systems, failed policies, corruption and a fundamental lack of political will.
And yet these cities-within-cities are wellsprings of entrepreneurial energy that can be mobilized to provide welfare improvements for their inhabitants and for society at large.
The World Bank and the United Nations have joined forces to respond to this challenge, by building a global alliance of cities and their development partners.
An ambitious “Cities without Slums” action plan was launched in December 1999, with President Nelson Mandela as its patron. It aims to improve the lives of 100 million slum dwellers by 2020.
I strongly support the Cities without Slums initiative and ask all Member States to endorse it and to act on it.
Nowhere is a global commitment to poverty reduction needed more than in Africa south of the Sahara, because no region of the world endures greater human suffering.
The latest estimates indicate that sub-Saharan Africa has the largest proportion of people who live on less than $1 a day.
Growth in per capita income averaged 1.5 per cent in the 1960s, 0.8 per cent in the 1970s, and minus 1.2 per cent in the 1980s.
In the 1990s, the region grew more slowly than any other group of middle- or low-income countries.
Today, per capita income is just $500 a year.
Private capital flows to Africa are a tiny fraction of global flows, and for some countries capital flight is several times their GDP.
Total outstanding external debts often exceed the entire gross national product, and it is not unusual for debt servicing requirements to exceed 25 per cent of export earnings.
Reversing these trends poses an enormous challenge to both domestic and international policy makers, and the difficulty of the task is multiplied manifold by the severity of Africa's AIDS crisis.
Extractive industries dominate the region's economy and resources are being depleted at an alarming rate.
Infrastructure requirements are enormous, particularly in the areas of power generation and telecommunications.
Electrical power consumption, per person, is the lowest in the world.
Africa has 14 telephone lines per 1,000 people, and less than half of 1 per cent of all Africans have used the Internet.
A mere 17 per cent of road surfaces is paved.
Yet Mozambique topped the world's GDP growth last year — before its recent devastating floods.
Higher commodity prices, of course, were a significant factor, but Mozambique, utterly impoverished and in the grip of an apparently intractable civil war only a few years ago, has taken great strides thanks to its own efforts.
Botswana, ranked second on the list, and several other countries in the region have enjoyed good economic performance and good governance for some time.
This results in high trade barriers, and poor delivery of public services.
It also means that corruption is widespread.
Firms in the private sector are unable to compete internationally because they lack access to appropriate technology and information.
The agricultural sector in Africa has yet to experience a Green Revolution.
Agricultural technologies developed in other climatic and ecological zones have not transferred well into the region.
Inputs like fertilizer are often controlled by state monopolies and are not available to farmers at competitive prices.
Fertilizer prices in the early 1990s, for example, were estimated to be two to four times higher in Africa than in Asia.
The poor infrastructure restricts the ability to move goods, so that transportation and shipping costs remain prohibitive.
Its urban centres remain small by international standards, and they have not provided the human capital necessary to fuel industrial expansion.
In many African countries there are political obstacles to economic progress as well. I addressed these issues in a report to the Security Council in April 1998.
Only Africans, I concluded in that report, can break out of these vicious cycles.
I am gratified that so many have chosen to do so, and that rulers who had perpetrated crimes against their own people are increasingly being held accountable for them.
Yet inexplicably, even today, relatively few African governments show the necessary commitment to poverty reduction in their national economic and social policies.
We do have the chance to turn things around.
There are many positive developments in Africa, and the international community has demonstrated a growing interest in assisting those African countries still afflicted by turmoil and tragedy.
These new frontiers raise both hopes and fears.
Better health and greater food security are within our reach, but in seizing the opportunities biotechnology presents we must not neglect the inherent risks.
In particular, we must ensure that free access is provided to the information compiled by researchers deciphering the genetic code.
The genetic key to human life belongs to all humanity.
I wish to focus here on a technological shift that is already transforming social and economic life: the digital revolution.
Fundamental changes are occurring in the communications and information industries, and at near-lightning speed (see fig. 4).
It took 38 years for radio to reach 50 million people, and 13 years for television. The same number of people adopted the Internet in just four years.
There were 50 pages on the World Wide Web in 1993; today there are more than 50 million.
A mere 143 million people logged on to the Internet in 1998; by 2001 the number of users will climb to 700 million.
The market for e-commerce was $2.6 billion in 1996; it is expected to grow to $300 billion by 2002.
And the Internet already has a far wider range of applications than any previous tool of communication ever invented.
There are more computers in the United States of America than in the rest of the world combined.
There are as many telephones in Tokyo as in all of Africa.
This digital divide can — and will — be bridged.
Already, the city of Bangalore in India has become a dynamic hub of innovation, boasting more than 300 high-tech companies.
India's software exports alone will exceed $4 billion this year — about 9 per cent of India's total exports — and industry sources project that they will reach $50 billion by 2008 (see box 3.
Costa Rica's economic growth surged to 8.3 per cent in 1999, the highest in Latin America, fuelled by exports from the microchip industry, which now accounts for 38 per cent of all exports.
I could give many other examples of developing countries seizing the opportunity of this revolution.
It holds great promise for economic growth and development, potentially for all countries.
To fully appreciate how the digital revolution can stimulate economic growth and development, we need to grasp several of its core features.
First, it has created a brand new economic sector that simply did not exist before.
As the countries at its forefront devote ever larger shares of their economies to this sector, a high-value space is opened up for others to occupy, and so on successively throughout the world economy.
This, indeed, is how the so-called emerging economies first “emerged” when other sectors were vacated.
Globalization facilitates such shifts.
Second, the capital that matters most in the digital revolution increasingly is intellectual capital.
Hardware costs are declining.
The shift from hardware to software as the cutting edge of the industry helps to overcome what has been a major impediment to development — the shortage of finance.
It also improves the chances for poor countries to leapfrog some long and painful stages in the development process.
Clearly, the requisite intellectual capital is not universally available, but it is far more widespread in the developing world and in the transition economies than is finance capital.
Third, the digital revolution, besides creating a new economic sector, is also a means to transform and enhance many other activities.
Mauritius, for example, uses the Internet to position its textile industry globally.
The UNCTAD Trade Point Programme allows participants to trade products on-line.
The Government of Mali has established an intranet to provide more effective administrative services.
And there are many other opportunities: for telemedicine and distance learning; for “virtual” banking coupled with microcredit; for checking weather forecasts before planting and crop prices before harvesting; for having the world's largest library at your fingertips; and so on.
The information technology sector, in short, can transform many if not most other sectors of economic and social activity.
Finally, the core product in this sector — information — has unique attributes, not shared by others.
The steel used to construct a building, or the boots worn by the workers constructing it, cannot be consumed by anyone else.
Information is different.
Not only is it available for multiple uses and users, it becomes more valuable the more it is used.
The same is true of the networks that link up different sources of information.
We in the policy-making world need to understand better how the economics of information differs from the economics of inherently scarce physical goods — and use it to advance our policy goals.
This is not to say that the transition will be easy for developing countries, especially the very poor.
Lack of resources and skills is part of the problem, inadequate basic infrastructure another, illiteracy and language a third, and, of course, there are concerns about privacy and content.
Technical solutions will become available for many of these problems, including wireless access, and even simple automatic translation programmes, enabling us to communicate and engage in e-commerce across language barriers.
For the immediate future, the individual consumer model of using information technology that prevails in the industrialized countries will prove too expensive for many developing ones.
But that constraint, too, can be overcome.
Public telecentres have been established in places from Peru to Kazakhstan.
In Egypt, for example, the United Nations Development Programme has helped to create Technology Access Community Centres to bring the Internet and fax service to poor and rural areas.
With help from civil society organizations and the private sector, we can expand these pilot programmes to reach even the remotest corners of the globe.
There is however no easy fix for the institutional impediments in many developing countries, above all unsupportive regulatory environments and exorbitant charges imposed by national authorities.
I encourage Member States to review their policies and arrangements in this area, to make sure that they are not denying their people the opportunities offered by the digital revolution.
As a concrete demonstration of how we can build bridges over digital divides, I am pleased to announce a new Health InterNetwork for developing countries.
This network will establish and operate 10,000 on-line sites in hospitals, clinics and public health facilities throughout the developing world.
It aims to provide access to relevant up-to-date health and medical information, tailored for specific countries or groups of countries.
The equipment and Internet access, wireless where necessary, will be provided by a consortium led by the WebMD Foundation, in cooperation with other foundation and corporate partners.
Training and capacity-building in developing countries is an integral part of the project.
The World Health Organization is leading the United Nations side in developing this initiative with external partners, including the United Nations Foundation.
I am also announcing a second digital bridges initiative: a United Nations Information Technology Service, which I propose to call UNITeS.
This will be a consortium of high-tech volunteer corps, including Net Corps Canada and Net Corps America, which United Nations Volunteers will help to coordinate.
UNITeS will train groups in developing countries in the uses and opportunities of information technology, and stimulate the creation of additional digital corps in the North and South.
We are currently exploring external sources of funding to support UNITeS.
G. Demonstrating global solidarity
Creating an inclusive global market is one of humanity's central challenges in the twenty-first century.
We are all impoverished if the poor are denied opportunities to make a living.
And it is within our power to extend these opportunities to all.
The rich countries have an indispensable role to play by further opening their markets, by providing deeper and faster debt relief, and by giving more and better-focused development assistance.
Despite decades of liberalization, the world trading system remains burdened with tariffs and quotas.
Most industrialized countries still protect their markets for agricultural products heavily, and all protect textiles — the two sectors in which the developing countries have a recognized comparative advantage.
Moreover, agricultural subsidies in the industrialized countries drive down world prices, hurting farmers in poor countries even more.
Everybody pays a high price for these practices.
The estimated cost per job “saved” in industrialized countries ranges from $30,000 to $200,000, depending on the industry.
Global economic losses from agricultural protectionism may be as high as $150 billion per year — about $20 billion of it in lost exports for developing countries.
Developing countries also cause a great deal of damage to themselves, however, by their own protectionist policies, in agriculture and elsewhere.
Rather than trying to freeze declining industries in place, which always fails in the long run, political leaders should make the case for upgrading skills through education and training, and for providing adjustment assistance.
The tenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, held recently in Bangkok, highlighted the need for better market access for the agricultural and industrial products exported by the least developed countries.
That would be particularly helpful to sub-Saharan Africa.
I urge the industrialized countries to consider granting duty-free and quota-free access for essentially all exports from the least developed countries — and to be prepared to endorse that commitment at the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries in March 2001.
A related issue of trade linkages has emerged in recent years.
I refer to the desire of some to make trade liberalization conditional on the developing countries' meeting certain standards in the areas of labour, the environment and human rights.
This issue must be handled with great care so that it does not become yet another pretext for protectionism.
I propose a different course.
First, in most of these areas agreements already exist on universal values and common standards — the fruit of many conferences and long negotiations.
What is needed now is for states to live up to their obligations, and for the relevant United Nations agencies to be given the resources and support to help them.
If that means that the world should have a more robust global environmental organization, for example, or that the International Labour Organization needs to be strengthened, then let us consider those possibilities.
Second, global companies must play a leadership role.
That is why I have invited the business community to join me in a “Global Compact” to enact in their own corporate practices a set of core values in three areas: labour standards, human rights and the environment (see box 4).
This initiative has been endorsed by a wide variety of business associations, labour groups and non-governmental organizations — and I hope to announce soon the first business leaders who are joining us to make the Global Compact an everyday reality.
Debt relief
High levels of external debt are a crushing burden on economic growth in many of the poorest countries.
Debt servicing requirements in hard currency prevent them from making adequate investments in education and health care, and from responding effectively to natural disasters and other emergencies.
Debt relief for those heavily indebted poor countries must, therefore, be an integral part of the international community's contribution to development.
Repeated rescheduling of these countries' bilateral debts has not significantly reduced their overall indebtedness.
In 1996, therefore, the international donor community launched an initiative to reduce these countries' debt to sustainable levels — the so-called HIPC initiative.
In the three years since its adoption, however, only four countries have fully qualified.
Another nine are reaching that point, while five others are engaged in preliminary discussions.
But progress has been slow.
A proposed expansion of the HIPC programme — agreed by the Cologne Summit of the G-8 in June 1999 and endorsed by the international financial institutions in September — provides for deeper, faster and broader debt relief.
But it has yet to be implemented. Other obstacles remain.
For instance, there is no mechanism for handling the large-scale restructuring of debt owed to foreign lenders by many private borrowers in the banking and corporate sector in developing countries.
I call upon the donor countries and the international financial institutions to consider wiping off their books all official debts of the heavily indebted poor countries in return for those countries making demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction.
In designing such national poverty reduction programmes, governments are encouraged to consult closely with civil society.
I would go a step further and propose that, in the future, we consider an entirely new approach to handling the debt problem.
The main components of such an approach could include immediate cancellation of the debts owed by countries that have suffered major conflicts or natural disasters; expanding the number of countries in the HIPC scheme by allowing them to qualify on grounds of poverty alone; pegging debt repayments at a maximum percentage of foreign exchange earnings; and establishing a debt arbitration process to balance the interests of creditors and sovereign debtors and introduce greater discipline into their relations.
Let us, above all, be clear that, without a convincing programme of debt relief to start the new millennium, our objective of halving world poverty by 2015 will be only a pipe dream.
Official development assistance
Development assistance — the third pillar of support by the international community — has been in steady decline for several decades.
Additional aid flows should be deployed to support the kinds of priorities I have described: programmes that encourage growth and help the poor.
For example, it could perhaps be used to offset some of the risk premium of private investment in poor countries.
The private sector can also be helpful in providing pre-investment assistance — as in the case of the partnership between UNCTAD and the International Chamber of Commerce to produce investment guides for the least developed countries (see box 5).
If external assistance programmes are to yield the best results, their administrative burdens on the countries they are supposed to help must be significantly reduced, and those countries must play a full part in designing them.
The United Nations Development Assistance Framework is a useful — and by all accounts, a successful — step in that direction (see box 6) — as are changes recently introduced by other agencies, including the World Bank.
But bilateral programmes still need to be far better coordinated.
As a result of globalization, the world's commitment to the poor is slowly coming to be seen, not only as a moral imperative but also as a common interest.
Each country must still take primary responsibility for its own programmes of economic growth and poverty reduction.
But ridding the world of the scourge of extreme poverty is a challenge to every one of us.
It is one that we must not fail to meet.
In the area of Europe that now comprises the European Union — where most modern wars started — a security community has emerged: an association of states characterized by dependable expectations that disputes will be resolved by peaceful means.
Moreover, nearly five decades of cold war — sustained by a nuclear balance of terror that could have annihilated us all instantly — have passed.
Some observers have lamented that fact, claiming that bipolarity was stable, predictable and helped keep the peace.
But that was hardly true in the developing world: there the cold war was a period of frequent armed conflict fuelled by both sides in the bipolar world.
Once the cold war ended, that source of external political and material support ceased to exist.
Freeing the United Nations from the shackles of the cold war also enabled it to play a more significant role.
The frequency of inter-state warfare has been declining for some time.
6.) Economic globalization has largely eliminated the benefits of territorial acquisition, while the destructiveness of modern warfare has increased its costs.
The near-doubling in the number of democracies since 1990 has been equally important, because established democratic states, for a variety of reasons, rarely fight each other militarily (see fig. 7).
Wars since the 1990s have been mainly internal.
They have been brutal, claiming more than 5 million lives.
They have violated, not so much borders, as people.
Humanitarian conventions have been routinely flouted, civilians and aid workers have become strategic targets, and children have been forced to become killers.
Often driven by political ambition or greed, these wars have preyed on ethnic and religious differences, they are often sustained by external economic interests, and they are fed by a hyperactive and in large part illicit global arms market.
In the wake of these conflicts, a new understanding of the concept of security is evolving.
Once synonymous with the defence of territory from external attack, the requirements of security today have come to embrace the protection of communities and individuals from internal violence.
As we look ahead, we can see real risks that resource depletion, especially freshwater scarcities, as well as severe forms of environmental degradation, may increase social and political tensions in unpredictable but potentially dangerous ways.
In short, these new security challenges require us to think creatively, and to adapt our traditional approaches to better meet the needs of our new era.
But one time-honoured precept holds more firmly today than ever: it all begins with prevention.
A. Preventing deadly conflicts
Consensus is not always matched by practical actions, however.
Political leaders find it hard to sell prevention policies abroad to their public at home, because the costs are palpable and immediate, while the benefits — an undesirable or tragic future event that does not occur — are more difficult for the leaders to convey and the public to grasp.
Thus prevention is, first and foremost, a challenge of political leadership.
If we are to be successful at preventing deadly conflicts, we must have a clear understanding of their causes.
Not all wars are alike; therefore no single strategy will be universally effective.
What is different about the wars that people have suffered since the beginning of the 1990s?
Some of those conflicts have already receded into the history books — along with those leaders — and it is to be hoped that the remainder soon will.
The majority of wars today are wars among the poor.
Why is this the case?
Poor countries have fewer economic and political resources with which to manage conflicts.
What this means is that every single measure I described in the previous section — every step taken towards reducing poverty and achieving broad-based economic growth — is a step towards conflict prevention.
All who are engaged in conflict prevention and development, therefore — the United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions, governments and civil society organizations — must address these challenges in a more integrated fashion.
In many poor countries at war, the condition of poverty is coupled with sharp ethnic or religious cleavages.
Almost invariably, the rights of subordinate groups are insufficiently respected, the institutions of government are insufficiently inclusive and the allocation of society's resources favours the dominant faction over others.
The solution is clear, even if difficult to achieve in practice: to promote human rights, to protect minority rights and to institute political arrangements in which all groups are represented.
Wounds that have festered for a long time will not heal overnight.
Nor can confidence be built or dialogues develop while fresh wounds are being inflicted.
Some armed conflicts today are driven by greed, not grievance.
Whereas war is costly for society as a whole, it nevertheless may be profitable for some.
In such cases, often the control over natural resources is at stake, drugs are often involved, the conflicts are abetted by opportunistic neighbours, and private sector actors are complicit — buying ill-gotten gains, helping to launder funds and feeding a steady flow of weapons into the conflict zone.
The best preventive strategy in this context is transparency: “naming and shaming”.
Civil society actors have an enormous role to play in this regard, but governments and the Security Council must exercise their responsibility.
Greater social responsibility on the part of global companies, including banks, is also essential.
Finally, successful strategies for prevention require us to ensure that old conflicts do not start up again, and that the necessary support is provided for post-conflict peace-building.
I regret to say that we do not fully enjoy that level of support in most of our missions.
While prevention is the core feature of our efforts to promote human security, we must recognize that even the best preventive and deterrence strategies can fail.
B. Protecting the vulnerable
Despite the existence of numerous international conventions intended to protect the vulnerable, the brutalization of civilians, particularly women and children, continues in armed conflicts.
Women have become especially vulnerable to violence and sexual exploitation, while children are easy prey for forced labour and are often coerced into becoming fighters.
Civilian populations and infrastructure have become covers for the operations of rebel movements, targets for reprisal and victims of the chaotic brutalities that too often follow breakdowns in state authority.
In the most extreme cases, the innocent become the principal targets of ethnic cleansers and genocidaires.
International conventions have traditionally looked to states to protect civilians, but today this expectation is threatened in several ways.
First, states are sometimes the principal perpetrators of violence against the very citizens that humanitarian law requires them to protect.
Second, non-state combatants, particularly in collapsed states, are often either ignorant or contemptuous of humanitarian law.
Third, international conventions do not adequately address the specific needs of vulnerable groups, such as internally displaced persons, or women and children in complex emergencies.
To strengthen protection, we must reassert the centrality of international humanitarian and human rights law.
We must strive to end the culture of impunity — which is why the creation of the International Criminal Court is so important.
We must also devise new strategies to meet changing needs.
New approaches in this area could include establishing a mechanism to monitor compliance by all parties with existing provisions of international humanitarian law.
Stronger legal standards are needed to provide for the protection of humanitarian workers.
Consideration should also be given to an international convention regulating the actions of private and corporate security firms, which we see involved in internal wars in growing numbers.
Greater use of information technology can also help to reduce the pain and burdens of complex emergencies for the people involved; one example is a programme called “Child Connect”, which helps reunite children and parents who have been separated in wars and natural disaster (see box 7).
Of one thing we may be certain: without protecting the vulnerable, our peace initiatives will be both fragile and illusory.
C. Addressing the dilemma of intervention
In my address to the General Assembly last September, I called on Member States to unite in the pursuit of more effective policies to stop organized mass murder and egregious violations of human rights.
Although I emphasized that intervention embraced a wide continuum of responses, from diplomacy to armed action, it was the latter option that generated most controversy in the debate that followed.
Some critics were concerned that the concept of “humanitarian intervention” could become a cover for gratuitous interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states.
Others felt that it might encourage secessionist movements deliberately to provoke governments into committing gross violations of human rights in order to trigger external interventions that would aid their cause.
I recognize both the force and the importance of these arguments.
I also accept that the principles of sovereignty and non-interference offer vital protection to small and weak states.
But to the critics I would pose this question: if humanitarian intervention is, indeed, an unacceptable assault on sovereignty, how should we respond to a Rwanda, to a Srebrenica — to gross and systematic violations of human rights that offend every precept of our common humanity?
We confront a real dilemma.
Few would disagree that both the defence of humanity and the defence of sovereignty are principles that must be supported.
Alas, that does not tell us which principle should prevail when they are in conflict.
Humanitarian intervention is a sensitive issue, fraught with political difficulty and not susceptible to easy answers.
But surely no legal principle — not even sovereignty — can ever shield crimes against humanity.
Where such crimes occur and peaceful attempts to halt them have been exhausted, the Security Council has a moral duty to act on behalf of the international community.
The fact that we cannot protect people everywhere is no reason for doing nothing when we can.
Armed intervention must always remain the option of last resort, but in the face of mass murder it is an option that cannot be relinquished.
D. Strengthening peace operations
With the end of the cold war confrontation and the paralysis it had induced in the Security Council, the decade of the 1990s became one of great activism for the United Nations.
More peace operations were mounted in that decade than in the previous four combined, and we developed new approaches to post-conflict peace-building and placed new emphasis on conflict prevention.
While traditional peacekeeping had focused mainly on monitoring ceasefires, today's complex peace operations are very different.
Their objective, in essence, is to assist the parties engaged in conflict to pursue their interests through political channels instead.
To that end, the United Nations helps to create and strengthen political institutions and to broaden their base.
International assistance to rebuild the economy is an essential complement to this work.
People will quickly become disillusioned with fledgling institutions, and even the peace process itself, if they see no prospect for any material improvement in their condition.
Post-conflict peace-building has helped to prevent the breakdown of numerous peace agreements, and to build the foundations for sustainable peace.
We can claim significant successes among our peace operations in the last decade or so, beginning with Namibia in the late 1980s, and including Mozambique, El Salvador, the Central African Republic, Eastern Slavonia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and, at least partially, Cambodia.
We also encountered tragic failures, none more so than Rwanda and the fall of Srebrenica and the other safe areas in Bosnia.
The many reasons for those failures, including those attributable to the United Nations Secretariat, are discussed frankly and in considerable detail in two reports I issued late last year.
The structural weaknesses of United Nations peace operations, however, only Member States can fix.
Our system for launching operations has sometimes been compared to a volunteer fire department, but that description is too generous.
Every time there is a fire, we must first find fire engines and the funds to run them before we can start dousing any flames.
The present system relies almost entirely on last minute, ad hoc arrangements that guarantee delay, with respect to the provision of civilian personnel even more so than military.
Although we have understandings for military standby arrangements with Member States, the availability of the designated forces is unpredictable and very few are in a state of high readiness.
Resource constraints preclude us even from being able to deploy a mission headquarters rapidly.
On the civilian side, we have been starkly reminded in Kosovo and East Timor how difficult it is to recruit qualified personnel for missions.
Where do we find police officers quickly, or judges, or people to run correctional institutions — to focus only on law enforcement needs?
A more systematic approach is necessary here as well.
To bring greater clarity to where we stand and how we can hope to progress with regard to United Nations peace operations, I have established a high-level panel, which will review all aspects of peace operations, from the doctrinal to the logistical.
It will suggest ways forward that are acceptable politically and make sense operationally.
I expect that the panel's report will be completed in time to enable the Millennium Assembly to consider its recommendations.
E. Targeting sanctions
During the 1990s, the United Nations established more sanctions regimes than ever before.
Sanctions, an integral element of the collective security provisions of the Charter, offer the Security Council an important instrument to enforce its decisions, situated on a continuum between mere verbal condemnation and recourse to armed force.
They include arms embargoes, the imposition of trade and financial restrictions, interruptions of relations by air and sea, and diplomatic isolation.
Sanctions have had an uneven track record in inducing compliance with Security Council resolutions.
In some cases, little if any effort has gone into monitoring and enforcing them.
In many cases, neighbouring countries that bear much of the loss from ensuring compliance have not been helped by the rest of the international community and, as a result, have allowed sanctions to become porous.
When robust and comprehensive economic sanctions are directed against authoritarian regimes, a different problem is encountered.
Then it is usually the people who suffer, not the political elites whose behaviour triggered the sanctions in the first place.
Indeed, those in power, perversely, often benefit from such sanctions by their ability to control and profit from black market activity, and by exploiting them as a pretext for eliminating domestic sources of political opposition.
Because economic sanctions have proved to be such a blunt and even counter-productive instrument, a number of governments, and numerous civil society organizations and think tanks around the world, have explored ways to make them smarter by better targeting them.
Switzerland has led an effort to design instruments of targeted financial sanctions, including drafting model national legislation required to implement them, and Germany is supporting work on how to make arms embargoes and other forms of targeted boycotts more effective.
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Canada have also contributed to the debate on how to target sanctions more effectively.
These efforts are now sufficiently well advanced to merit serious consideration by Member States.
I invite the Security Council, in particular, to bear them in mind when designing and applying sanctions regimes.
F. Pursuing arms reductions
The post-cold-war era has seen both gains and setbacks in the realm of disarmament.
On the positive side, the Ottawa Convention banning landmines and the Chemical Weapons Convention have both entered into force.
The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has been concluded, nuclear safeguards have been strengthened and nuclear-weapon-free zones now embrace all of the southern hemisphere.
Nuclear weapons numbers have almost halved since 1982, and world military expenditures declined by some 30 per cent between 1990 and 1998 (see figs.
The rest of the picture is much less encouraging.
Little meaningful progress has been achieved in limiting the proliferation of small arms.
The nuclear non-proliferation regime has suffered major blows as a result of clandestine nuclear weapon programmes, the nuclear tests in South Asia and the unwillingness of key states to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.
Advances in biotechnology are increasing the potential threat posed by biological weapons, while negotiations on a verification regime for the Biological Weapons Convention are being unnecessarily prolonged.
For three years in a row now, the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva has not engaged in any negotiations because its members have been unable to agree on disarmament priorities.
I cannot here review the entire arms control spectrum.
Instead, I focus on two categories of weapon that are of special concern: small arms and light weapons, because they currently kill most people in most wars; and nuclear weapons, because of their continuing terrifying potential for mass destruction.
The death toll from small arms dwarfs that of all other weapons systems — and in most years greatly exceeds the toll of the atomic bombs that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
In terms of the carnage they cause, small arms, indeed, could well be described as “weapons of mass destruction”.
Yet there is still no global non-proliferation regime to limit their spread, as there is for chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.
Small arms proliferation is not merely a security issue; it is also an issue of human rights and of development.
The proliferation of small arms sustains and exacerbates armed conflicts.
It endangers peacekeepers and humanitarian workers.
It undermines respect for international humanitarian law.
It threatens legitimate but weak governments and it benefits terrorists as well as the perpetrators of organized crime.
Much of the cold war's small arms surplus finished up in the world's most dangerous conflict zones and, as the number of weapons in circulation increased, their price declined, making access to them ever easier even in the poorest countries.
In parts of Africa in the mid-1990s, for example, deadly assault rifles could be bought for the price of a chicken or a bag of maize.
Reducing the toll caused by these weapons will be difficult, not least because of the extraordinary number in circulation, which some estimates put as high as 500 million.
An estimated 50 to 60 per cent of the world's trade in small arms is legal — but legally exported weapons often find their way into the illicit market.
The task of effective proliferation control is made far harder than it needs to be because of irresponsible behaviour on the part of some states and lack of capacity by others, together with the shroud of secrecy that veils much of the arms trade.
Member States must act to increase transparency in arms transfers if we are to make any progress.
I would also urge that they support regional disarmament measures, like the moratorium on the importing, exporting or manufacturing of light weapons in West Africa.
Even if all arms transfers could be eliminated, however, the problem posed by the many millions of illicitly held small arms already in circulation in the world's war zones would remain.
Because most conflict-prone poor countries lack the capacity to detect and seize illicit weapons, a more promising path may be the use of market incentives.
Outright buy-back programmes may simply stimulate arms imports from neighbouring countries, but non-monetary reimbursement schemes have worked in Albania, El Salvador, Mozambique and Panama.
This would be a particularly appropriate contribution by major international corporations that have a presence in conflict-prone regions.
Controlling the proliferation of illicit weapons is a necessary first step towards the non-proliferation of small arms.
These weapons must be brought under the control of states, and states must be held accountable for their transfer.
The United Nations is convening a conference on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in 2001, in which I hope civil society organizations will be invited to participate fully.
I urge Member States to take advantage of this conference to start taking serious actions that will curtail the illicit traffic in small arms.
The many recent expressions of concern about small arms proliferation are a welcome sign that the importance of the issue is being recognized, but words alone do nothing to prevent the ongoing slaughter of innocent people.
Dialogue is critical, but we must match the rhetoric of concern with the substance of practical action.
When the bipolar balance of nuclear terror passed into history,
the concern with nuclear weapons also seemed to drift from public consciousness.
But some 35,000 nuclear weapons remain in the arsenals of the nuclear powers, with thousands still deployed on hair-trigger alert.
Whatever rationale these weapons may once have had has long since dwindled.
Political, moral and legal constraints on actually using them further undermine their strategic utility without, however, reducing the risks of inadvertent war or proliferation.
The objective of nuclear non-proliferation is not helped by the fact that the nuclear weapon states continue to insist that those weapons in their hands enhance security, while in the hands of others they are a threat to world peace.
If we were making steady progress towards disarmament, this situation would be less alarming.
Unfortunately the reverse is true.
Not only are the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks stalled, but there are no negotiations at all covering the many thousands of so-called tactical nuclear weapons in existence, or the weapons of any nuclear power other than those of the Russian Federation and the United States of America.
Moreover, unless plans to deploy missile defences are devised with the agreement of all concerned parties, the progress achieved thus far in reducing the number of nuclear weapons may be jeopardized.
Confidence-building is required to reassure states that their nuclear deterrent capabilities will not be negated.
Above all else, we need a reaffirmation of political commitment at the highest levels to reducing the dangers that arise both from existing nuclear weapons and from further proliferation.
To help focus attention on the risks we confront and on the opportunities we have to reduce them, I propose that consideration be given to convening a major international conference that would help to identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers.
V. Sustaining our future
The founders of the United Nations set out, in the words of the Charter, to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom — above all, freedom from want and freedom from fear.
In 1945, they could not have anticipated, however, the urgent need we face today to realize yet a third: the freedom of future generations to sustain their lives on this planet.
We are failing to provide that freedom.
On the contrary, we have been plundering our children's future heritage to pay for environmentally unsustainable practices in the present.
The natural environment performs for us, free of charge, basic services without which our species could not survive.
The ozone layer screens out ultraviolet rays from the sun that harm people, animals and plants.
Ecosystems help purify the air we breathe and the water we drink.
They convert wastes into resources and reduce atmospheric carbon levels that would otherwise contribute to global warming.
Biodiversity provides a bountiful store of medicines and food products, and it maintains genetic variety that reduces vulnerability to pests and diseases.
But we are degrading, and in some cases destroying, the ability of the environment to continue providing these life-sustaining services for us.
During the past hundred years, the natural environment has borne the stresses imposed by a fourfold increase in human numbers and an eighteenfold growth in world economic output.
With world population projected to increase to nearly 9 billion by 2050, from the current 6 billion, the potential for doing irreparable environmental harm is obvious.
One of two jobs worldwide — in agriculture, forestry and fisheries — depends directly on the sustainability of ecosystems.
Even more important, so does the planet's health — and our own.
Environmental sustainability is everybody's challenge.
In the rich countries, the by-products of industrial and agribusiness production poison soils and waterways.
In the developing countries, massive deforestation, harmful farming practices and uncontrolled urbanization are major causes of environmental degradation.
Carbon dioxide emissions are widely believed to be a major source of global climate change, and the burning of fossil fuels is their main source.
The one fifth of the world's population living in the industrialized countries accounts for nearly 60 per cent of the world's total consumption of energy, but the developing world's share is rising rapidly.
Our goal must be to meet the economic needs of the present without compromising the ability of the planet to provide for the needs of future generations.
We have made progress since 1972, when the United Nations convened the first global conference ever to address environmental issues.
That conference stimulated the creation of environmental ministries throughout the world, established the United Nations Environment Programme and led to a vast increase in the number of civil society organizations promoting environmental concerns.
Twenty years later, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development provided the foundations for agreements on climate change, forests and biodiversity.
It adopted an indicative policy framework intended to help achieve the goal of sustainable development — in rich and poor countries alike.
Perhaps the single most successful international environmental agreement to date has been the Montreal Protocol, in which states accepted the need to phase out the use of ozone-depleting substances (see box 8).
Nevertheless, we must face up to an inescapable reality: the challenges of sustainability simply overwhelm the adequacy of our responses.
With some honourable exceptions, our responses are too few, too little and too late.
This section is intended to convey that reality to the Millennium Summit with a particular sense of urgency.
The fact that environmental issues were never seriously considered in the nearly 18 months during which the General Assembly debated which subjects to include in the Summit's agenda makes it plain how little priority is accorded to these extraordinarily serious challenges for all humankind.
Leadership at the very highest level is imperative if we are to bequeath a liveable Earth to our children — and theirs.
The 10-year follow-up to the Conference on Environment and Development will be held in 2002.
It is my hope that the world's leaders will take advantage of the time remaining to revitalize the sustainability debate and to prepare the ground for the adoption of concrete and meaningful actions by that time.
A. Coping with climate change
Spurred by a quadrupling of carbon emissions during the past half-century alone, Earth's atmosphere is warming at an increasing rate (see fig. 10). The hottest 14 years since systematic measurements began in the 1860s have all occurred in the past two decades; the summer of 1998 was the hottest on record, and the winter of 1999-2000 may turn out to be the warmest.
Average temperatures are projected to increase further, by 1.2° to 3.5° C (2° to 6° F) over the course of the present century — which would melt glaciers and the polar ice caps, raise sea levels and pose threats to hundreds of millions of coastal dwellers while drowning low-lying islands altogether.
Portents of this future are already visible.
As the warming trend has accelerated, weather patterns have become more volatile and more extreme, while the severity of weather-related disasters has escalated.
The cost of natural disasters in 1998 alone exceeded the cost of all such disasters in the entire decade of the 1980s (see fig. 11). Tens of thousands of mostly poor people were killed that year, and an estimated 25 million “environmental refugees” were forced from their homes.
The damage wrought by these disasters has been exacerbated by unsustainable environmental practices and the fact that more and more poor people have little choice but to live in harm's way — on flood plains and unstable hillsides and in unsafe buildings.
Reducing the threat of global warming requires, above all, that carbon emissions be reduced.
The burning of fossil fuels, which still provide more than 75 per cent of energy worldwide, produces most of these emissions.
The need to promote energy-efficiency and greater reliance on renewable resources is obvious.
In the developing world, particularly in rural areas that are not connected to energy grids, the rapidly falling costs of solar cells and wind power have the potential to bring energy to the poor at reasonable costs, thereby also enhancing agricultural productivity and generating income.
Stabilizing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to a range that is considered safe will require overall reductions on the order of 60 per cent or more in the emission of the “greenhouse gases” that are responsible for global warming.
Thus far, the international community has not found the political will needed to make the necessary changes.
Implementing the 1997 Kyoto Protocol would mark a significant advance by binding the industrialized countries to verifiable emission limitation and reduction targets averaging 5 per cent below 1990 levels, to be achieved over the period 2008-2012.
Recognizing the economic roots of the climate change problem, the Protocol seeks to engage the private sector in the search for solutions.
It does so by the use of market mechanisms that provide incentives for cutting emissions, and which stimulate investment and technology flows to developing countries that will help them achieve more sustainable patterns of industrialization (see box 9).
Although the first generation of Kyoto targets represent just one step towards what is needed to reduce global warming, their achievement would result in a sharp reduction in current rates of increase of greenhouse gas emissions by the industrialized countries (see fig. 12). Early action is essential.
Without success, there will be little incentive for the further rounds of emission limitations that must follow, in which the developing countries will need to become progressively engaged.
I call upon the Millennium Summit to promote the adoption and implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.
Specifically, I urge those States whose ratifications are needed to bring it into effect to take the necessary action in time for entry into force by 2002, as a fitting celebration of our progress since Stockholm in 1972 and Rio in 1992.
In several other areas, there are severe challenges for which we still lack remotely adequate responses.
B. Confronting the water crisis
Global freshwater consumption rose sixfold between 1900 and 1995 — more than twice the rate of population growth.
About one third of the world's population already lives in countries considered to be “water stressed” — that is, where consumption exceeds 10 per cent of total supply.
If present trends continue, two out of every three people on Earth will live in that condition by 2025.
Groundwater supplies about one third of the world's population.
The unsustainable, but largely unnoticed, exploitation of these water resources is a particular source of concern.
The withdrawal of groundwater in quantities greater than nature's ability to renew it is widespread in parts of the Arabian Peninsula, China, India, Mexico, the former Soviet Union and the United States.
In some cases, water tables are falling by 1 to 3 metres a year.
In a world where 30 to 40 per cent of food production comes from irrigated lands, this is a critical issue for food security.
There is already fierce national competition over water for irrigation and power generation in some of the world's regions, which is likely to worsen as populations continue to grow.
Today, the Middle East and North Africa are most seriously affected by water scarcity, but sub-Saharan Africa will join them over the next half-century as its population doubles and even triples.
Sheer shortages of freshwater are not the only problem.
Fertilizer run-off and chemical pollution threaten both water quality and public health.
More than one fifth of freshwater fish stocks are already vulnerable or endangered because of pollution or habitat modification.
The most serious immediate challenge is the fact that more than 1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water, while half of humanity lacks adequate sanitation.
Unsafe water and poor sanitation cause an estimated 80 per cent of all diseases in the developing world.
The annual death toll exceeds 5 million, 10 times the number killed in wars, on average, each year.
More than half of the victims are children.
No single measure would do more to reduce disease and save lives in the developing world than bringing safe water and adequate sanitation to all.
The World Water Forum's Ministerial Conference, which met in March 2000, considered a set of realistically achievable targets on water and sanitation.
I ask the Millennium Summit to endorse these targets and to build on them in the years ahead.
Specifically, I urge the Summit to adopt the target of reducing by half, between now and 2015, the proportion of people who lack sustainable access to adequate sources of affordable and safe water.
To arrest the unsustainable exploitation of water resources, we require water management strategies at national level and local levels.
They should include pricing structures that promote both equity and efficiency.
We need a “Blue Revolution” in agriculture that focuses on increasing productivity per unit of water — “more crop per drop” — together with far better watershed and flood plain management.
But none of this will happen without public awareness and mobilization campaigns, to bring home to people the extent and causes of current and impending water crises.
C. Defending the soil
In principle, there is no reason why Earth could not support far more than its present population.
In reality, however, the distribution of good soils and favourable growing conditions does not match that of populations.
Increasing land degradation exacerbates that problem.
Nearly 2 billion hectares of land — an area about the combined size of Canada and the United States — is affected by human-induced degradation of soils, putting the livelihoods of nearly 1 billion people at risk.
The major culprits are irrigation-induced salinization, soil erosion caused by overgrazing and deforestation, and biodiversity depletion.
The direct cost alone, in terms of annual income forgone, has been estimated at more than $40 billion a year.
Each year an additional 20 million hectares of agricultural land becomes too degraded for crop production, or is lost to urban sprawl.
Yet over the next 30 years the demand for food in the developing countries is expected to double.
New land can and will be farmed, but much of it is marginal and, therefore, even more highly susceptible to degradation.
Increases in farm productivity, boosted by new high-yield plant varieties and a ninefold increase in fertilizer use, have prevented the Doomsday scenarios of global famine that were predicted in the 1970s — but often at considerable environmental cost.
The rate of increase in global agricultural productivity slowed dramatically in the 1990s, and sub-Saharan Africa never enjoyed its benefits.
The absence of secure land tenure is also a serious impediment to improved agricultural productivity and soil management.
Meanwhile, world population is expected to increase by more than 3 billion by mid-century, with the biggest growth coming in the countries that already contain the largest number of hungry people and the most stressed farmlands.
Thus the world faces a real threat to future global food security.
Plant scientists currently are unable to repeat the huge gains in plant yields they achieved in recent decades, land degradation is increasing, returns from fertilizer application are diminishing in many areas and there are serious constraints on expanding irrigation.
Advances in agricultural biotechnology may help developing countries by creating drought-, salt- and pest-resistant crop varieties.
But the environmental impact of biotechnology has yet to be fully evaluated and many questions, in particular those related to biosafety, remain to be answered.
I intend to convene a high-level global public policy network to address these and related controversies concerning the risks and opportunities associated with the increased use of biotechnology and bioengineering.
Of course, not every country has to produce all its own food.
Shortfalls in supply can be met by imports from food-surplus countries, an increasingly common practice.
But, apart from emergency aid, this is a solution to food production deficits only if the countries and people in need of food have the purchasing power to acquire it.
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, no fewer than 82 countries lack those resources.
D. Preserving forests, fisheries and biodiversity
Increasing populations and economic growth continue to drive a seemingly insatiable global demand for forest products.
Some 65 million hectares of forest were lost in the developing world between 1990 and 1995 because of over-harvesting, conversion into agricultural land, disease and fire.
The high demand for timber in the industrialized countries was a major factor behind this depletion.
Nevertheless, growing demand need not necessarily generate ever-greater destruction of forests.
Major efficiency gains can be achieved in the production of paper and wood products; greater use of recycling can conserve materials and electronic publishing can save paper.
Reforestation provides for future timber needs and helps to absorb carbon from the atmosphere, thus reducing global warming.
It enhances flood control and helps to prevent soil erosion.
The need to preserve biodiversity is a less self-evident conservation issue than polluted beaches, burning forests or expanding deserts.
But it is as critical, if not more so.
Conserving agricultural biodiversity is essential for long-term food security, because wild plants are genetic sources of resistance to disease, drought and salinization.
Biodiversity is not only important for agriculture.
Plant-based medicines provide more than 3 billion people with their primary health care and comprise a multi-billion dollar a year global industry.
But as scientific and commercial awareness of the value of plant-based medicines grows, the plants are coming under increasing threat.
According to a recent survey of nearly a quarter of a million plant species, one in every eight is at risk of extinction.
The survival of some 25 per cent of the world's mammal species and 11 per cent of bird species is also threatened.
As long as deforestation, land and water degradation, and monoculture cropping continue to increase, the threats to biodiversity will continue to grow.
Ocean fisheries continue to be stressed despite the large number of regulatory agreements in place.
Fish catches have increased nearly fivefold during the last half-century, but almost 70 per cent of ocean fisheries are either fully exploited or over-fished.
Unregulated, winner-take-all fishing practices using so-called factory ships, often heavily state subsidized, cause overexploitation of ocean fisheries and can also destroy the livelihoods of small fishing communities, particularly in the developing world.
Coastal waters can be protected from unregulated foreign fishing fleets, but they confront different threats.
Fish breeding stocks and nursery grounds are threatened in many regions by the growing degradation of coral reefs.
More than half the world's coral reefs are currently at risk as the result of human activities.
The complete collapse of many once-valuable fisheries provides compelling evidence that a more sustainable and equitable ocean governance regime is needed.
The importance of conservation is increasingly recognized, but it can flourish only if governments and the fishing industry work cooperatively to support it.
E. Building a new ethic of global stewardship
These crises do not admit of easy or uniform solutions.
Moreover, there is every reason to expect that unpleasant ecological surprises lie ahead.
It is worth recalling that neither global warming nor ozone depletion were on the agenda of the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm.
Nor would anyone in 1970 have predicted that the cost of natural disasters would increase 900 per cent between the 1960s and 1990s.
It is true that technological breakthroughs that are unimaginable today may solve some of the environmental challenges we confront.
Perhaps they will, and we should surely provide incentives to increase the likelihood of their occurring.
But it would be foolish to count on them and to continue with business as usual.
So the question remains, what should our priorities be?
First, major efforts in public education are needed.
Real understanding of the challenges we face is alarmingly low.
As more and more of us live in cities, insulated from nature, the need for greater awareness grows.
Consumers everywhere have to understand that their choices often have significant environmental consequences.
Much of the burden of consciousness-raising to date has fallen on civil society organizations.
With energy, commitment, but few resources, non-governmental organizations have advocated environmental issues in public debates almost everywhere.
Schools and universities also have a critical role to play in raising public consciousness, and governments themselves must step up their contributions.
Second, environmental issues must be fundamentally repositioned in the policy-making process.
Governments typically treat the environment as an isolated category, assigned to a relatively junior ministry.
This is a major obstacle to achieving sustainable development.
Instead, the environment must become better integrated into mainstream economic policy.
The surest way to achieve that goal is to modify systems of national accounts so that they begin to reflect true environmental costs and benefits — to move towards “green” accounting.
Today, when factories produce goods but in the process pump pollutants into rivers or the atmosphere, national accounts measure the value of the goods but not the costs inflicted by the pollutants.
In the long run, these unmeasured costs may greatly exceed the measured short-term benefits.
Only when they reflect a fuller accounting can economic policies ensure that development is sustainable.
The System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting, pioneered by the United Nations in 1993, is a response to this challenge.
It augments traditional national accounts with natural resource and pollution flow accounts.
This additional information enables governments to formulate and monitor economic policies more effectively, enact more effective environmental regulations and resource management strategies, and use taxes and subsidies more efficiently.
Although this system of green accounting is still a work in progress, it is already employed by national governments.
The Government of the Philippines started using it in 1995.
Another 20 or so countries, North and South, are using elements of it.
I encourage governments to consider this system of green accounting carefully and identify ways to incorporate it into their own national accounts.
Third, only governments can create and enforce environmental regulations, and devise more environment-friendly incentives for markets to respond to.
To cite but one example, governments can make markets work for the environment by cutting the hundreds of billions of dollars that subsidize environmentally harmful activities each and every year.
Another is by making greater use of “green taxes”, based on the “polluter pays” principle.
Creating new incentives also encourages the emergence of entirely new industries, devoted to achieving greater energy efficiency and other environment-friendly practices.
The success of the Montreal Protocol, for instance, has created a large market for ozone-safe refrigerators and air conditioners.
Nothing would be more foolish than neglecting the enormously positive role the private sector can play in promoting environmental change.
Finally, it is impossible to devise effective environmental policy unless it is based on sound scientific information.
While major advances in data collection have been made in many areas, large gaps in our knowledge remain.
In particular, there has never been a comprehensive global assessment of the world's major ecosystems.
The planned Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, a major international collaborative effort to map the health of our planet, is a response to this need.
I call on Member States to help provide the necessary financial support for the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and to become actively engaged in it.
Different regions of the world face very different environmental problems, which require different solutions.
But the peoples of our small planet share at least one common view about their predicament: they want their governments to do more to protect their environment.
They ask that for themselves, and even more so for their children — and for the future of the planet itself.
Given the extraordinary risks humanity confronts, the start of the new century could not be a more opportune time to commit ourselves — peoples as well as governments — to a new ethic of conservation and stewardship.
Renewing the United Nations
The United Nations alone can meet none of the challenges I have described.
Whether the world's peoples have such an organization at their disposal depends ultimately, now as in the past, on the commitment of their governments to it.
Now, as then, the Member States are the very foundation of the United Nations.
Today, global affairs are no longer the exclusive province of foreign ministries, nor are states the sole source of solutions for our small planet's many problems.
Many diverse and increasingly influential non-state actors have joined with national decision makers to improvise new forms of global governance.
The more complex the problem at hand — whether negotiating a ban on landmines, setting limits to emissions that contribute to global warming, or creating an International Criminal Court — the more likely we are to find non-governmental organizations, private sector institutions and multilateral agencies working with sovereign states to find consensus solutions.
I believe two strategies will be essential to realize the potential of our Organization in the years ahead.
First, while our own resources as an organization are tightly constrained, those of the communities we serve are much greater.
We must strive, not to usurp the role of other actors on the world stage, but to become a more effective catalyst for change and coordination among them.
Our most vital role will be to stimulate collective action at the global level.
Second, the United Nations — like all other institutions in the world today — must fully exploit the great promise of the Information Age.
The digital revolution has unleashed an unprecedented wave of technological change.
Used responsibly, it can greatly improve our chances of defeating poverty and better meeting our other priority objectives.
If this is to happen, we in the United Nations need to embrace the new technologies more wholeheartedly than we have in the past.
A. Identifying our core strengths
When it was created more than half a century ago, in the convulsive aftermath of world war, the United Nations reflected humanity's greatest hopes for a just and peaceful global community.
It still embodies that dream.
We remain the only global institution with the legitimacy and scope that derive from universal membership, and a mandate that encompasses development, security and human rights as well as the environment.
In this sense, the United Nations is unique in world affairs.
We are an organization without independent military capability, and we dispose of relatively modest resources in the economic realm.
Yet our influence and impact on the world is far greater than many believe to be the case — and often more than we ourselves realize.
This influence derives not from any exercise of power, but from the force of the values we represent; our role in helping to establish and sustain global norms; our ability to stimulate global concern and action; and the trust we enjoy for the practical work we do on the ground to improve people's lives.
The importance of principles and norms is easily underestimated; but in the decades since the United Nations was created, the spreading acceptance of new norms has profoundly affected the lives of many millions of people.
War was once a normal instrument of statecraft; it is now universally proscribed, except in very specific circumstances.
Democracy, once challenged by authoritarianism in various guises, has not only prevailed in much of the world, but is now generally seen as the most legitimate and desirable form of government.
The protection of fundamental human rights, once considered the province of sovereign states alone, is now a universal concern transcending both governments and borders.
The United Nations conferences of the 1990s were sometimes marked by discord, but they have played a central role in forging normative consensus and spelling out practical solutions on the great issues of the day.
Nowhere else has it been possible for the international community as a whole to sketch out responses to the dawning challenge of globalization on which all, or almost all, could agree.
Indeed, it is on those responses that this report seeks to build.
More recently we have seen an upsurge of transnational single-issue campaigns to strengthen norms and build legal regimes, leading for instance to the convention banning landmines or to last year's agreement on enhanced debt relief for the most heavily indebted poor countries.
These campaigns, often conducted in concert with the United Nations, have helped to raise — and alter — the consciousness of the international community and to change the behaviour of states on many critical global issues.
The United Nations plays an equally important, but largely unsung, role in creating and sustaining the global rules without which modern societies simply could not function.
The World Health Organization, for example, sets quality criteria for the pharmaceutical industry worldwide.
The World Meteorological Office collates weather data from individual states and redistributes it, which in turn improves global weather forecasting.
The World Intellectual Property Organization protects trademarks and patents outside their country of origin.
Indeed, it is impossible to imagine our globalized world without the principles and practice of multilateralism to underpin it.
An open world economy, in the place of mercantilism; a gradual decrease in the importance of competitive military alliances coupled with a Security Council more often able to reach decisions; the General Assembly or great gatherings of states and civil society organizations addressing humanity's common concerns — these are some of the signs, partial and halting though they may be, of an indispensable multilateral system in action.
Taking a long-term view, the expansion of the rule of law has been the foundation of much of the social progress achieved in the last millennium.
Of course, this remains an unfinished project, especially at the international level, and our efforts to deepen it continue.
Support for the rule of law would be enhanced if countries signed and ratified international treaties and conventions.
Some decline to do so for reasons of substance, but a far greater number simply lack the necessary expertise and resources, especially when national legislation is needed to give force to international instruments.
Therefore, I am asking all relevant United Nations entities to provide the necessary technical assistance that will make it possible for every willing state to participate fully in the emerging global legal order.
We will provide special facilities at the Millennium Summit for Heads of State or Government to add their signatures to any treaty or convention of which the Secretary-General is the depositary.
As global norms evolve, institutions have evolved with them.
In recent years, for example, we have witnessed the creation of ad hoc tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, in response to the international community's growing concern about gross violations of human rights and its determination to end the “culture of impunity”.
I strongly urge all countries to sign and ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, so as to consolidate and extend the gains we have achieved in bringing to justice those responsible for crimes against humanity.
The United Nations must also adapt itself to the changing times.
One critical area, to which I have already referred, is reform of the Security Council.
The Council must work effectively, but it must also enjoy unquestioned legitimacy.
Those two criteria define the space within which a solution must be found.
I urge Member States to tackle this challenge without delay.
We also need to adapt our deliberative work so that it can benefit fully from the contributions of civil society.
Already, civil society organizations have made an important contribution to articulating and defending global norms.
(For the number of non-governmental organizations, see fig.
13.) It is clear that the United Nations and the world's people have much to gain from opening the Organization further to this vital source of energy and expertise — just as we have gained from closer institutional links and practical cooperation with national parliaments.
I would ask the General Assembly, therefore, to explore ways of improving these relationships.
As a first step, an expert group, including representatives of civil society organizations, might be asked to prepare a study of innovative “best practices” in how those organizations contribute to the work of the United Nations in all its aspects.
Such a study could form the basis for adopting new ways of involving civil society more fully in our common endeavours.
Partnerships with the private sector and foundations have also become extremely important to our recent successes, as I have noted in several instances in this report.
B. Networking for change
The rapid pace of change today frequently exceeds the capacity of national and international institutions to adapt.
So many things are changing at once that no organization on its own can keep track of them all — especially as the changes generally cut across traditional boundaries between academic disciplines and professional fields of expertise.
Part of the solution may be found in the emergence of “global policy networks”.
These networks — or coalitions for change — bring together international institutions, civil society and private sector organizations, and national governments, in pursuit of common goals.
Sometimes international organizations are in the lead — the World Health Organization, for example, in the Roll Back Malaria campaign, or my own office in the case of the Global Compact with the private sector.
In other instances a few national governments and non-governmental organizations are the driving force, as was the case with the campaign to ban landmines.
In the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization the private sector and philanthropic foundations are the major players.
In every case, these loose creative coalitions give new meaning to the phrase “we the peoples”, by showing that global governance is not a zero-sum game. All the partners in such a network see their influence increase.
States, in particular, gain from joining global policy networks because they can achieve cooperatively what is impossible unilaterally.
Though they can take many different forms, global policy networks share a number of characteristics.
They are non-hierarchical and give voice to civil society.
They help set global policy agendas, frame debates and raise public consciousness.
They develop and disseminate knowledge, making extensive use of the Internet.
They make it easier to reach consensus and negotiate agreements on new global standards, as well as to create new kinds of mechanisms for implementing and monitoring those agreements.
Our involvement with global policy networks has been extensive but largely unplanned.
We need a more focused and systematic approach.
We need to determine how best to help governments, civil society and the private sector to work together to ensure that policy networks succeed in achieving their — and our — goals.
C. Making digital connections
Earlier in this report, I discussed the vital importance of bridging the global digital divide.
Here, I want to suggest how the Information Revolution can and must benefit the United Nations itself.
We can now read newspapers on-line from every corner of the world within seconds of their publication.
We can find and download information from national government departments, leading overseas research institutions and key non-governmental organizations just as quickly.
This is not all.
Increased global connectivity also means that every year the vast electronic treasure house of information available on the United Nations web site becomes accessible at no cost to millions more people.
The popularity of our web site is extraordinary — it received more than 100 million “hits” last year.
The Internet also makes it possible for us to hold interactive global electronic conferences, which not only save airfares, hotel bills and conference costs, but can as easily and cheaply host 10,000 participants as 10.
Within the Secretariat, we can substitute electronic “meetings” for many face-to-face ones, thereby making far more efficient use of staff time.
This is increasingly the practice in modern organizations that have embraced the Information Revolution.
Finally, the Information Revolution has the potential to radically improve the efficiency of our field operations.
Wireless communications work even under the worst conditions, including natural disasters and emergencies.
I am pleased to announce the launch of a new disaster response programme, which will provide and maintain mobile and satellite telephones as well as microwave links for humanitarian relief workers.
This initiative will be led by Ericsson, in partnership with United Nations entities and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (see box 11).
Logistical planning and operations in complex emergencies can also benefit from better use of available technology.
In Kosovo, for example, the International Rescue Committee created a shared satellite/wireless Internet network in Pristina. Every United Nations agency, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, several national missions and the majority of non-governmental organizations are connected via the network around the clock.
Up to now, however, the United Nations has scarcely tapped the potential of the Information Revolution.
We remain handicapped by a change-resistant culture, inadequate information technology infrastructure, lack of training and, above all, failure to understand the great benefits that information technology can provide when used creatively.
We need to update and upgrade our internal information technology capacity.
There is enormous scope for the entire United Nations system to become better integrated, on-line, providing the world's people with information and data of concern to them.
In cooperation with other members of the United Nations family, I shall pursue these objectives with great vigour.
I will also be appealing to the information technology industry for assistance in rebuilding the United Nations information technology infrastructure and capacity.
D. Advancing the quiet revolution
If the international community were to create a new United Nations tomorrow, its make-up would surely be different from the one we have.
In 2000, our structure reflects decades of mandates conferred by Member States and, in some cases, the legacy of deep political disagreements.
While there is widespread consensus on the need to make the United Nations a more modern and flexible organization, unless Member States are willing to contemplate real structural reform, there will continue to be severe limits to what we can achieve.
When the scope of our responsibilities and the hopes invested in us are measured against our resources, we confront a sobering truth.
The budget for our core functions — the Secretariat operations in New York, Geneva, Nairobi, Vienna and five regional commissions — is just $1.25 billion a year. That is about 4 per cent of New York City's annual budget — and nearly a billion dollars less than the annual cost of running Tokyo's Fire Department.
Our resources simply are not commensurate with our global tasks.
Our difficulties in coping with stagnant budgets and non-payment of dues are well known. Less well understood are the strains that Member States impose on us by adding new mandates without adding new resources.
We can do more with less, but only up to a point.
Sooner or later the quality of our work must suffer.
The constraints are not only financial.
In many areas we cannot do our job because disagreements among Member States preclude the consensus needed for effective action.
This is perhaps most obvious with respect to peace operations, but it affects other areas as well.
Moreover, the highly intrusive and excessively detailed mode of oversight that Member States exercise over our programme activities makes it very difficult for us to maximize efficiency or effectiveness.
The “quiet revolution” I launched in 1997 was designed to make the United Nations a leaner and more effective organization.
Since then we have streamlined management procedures, shifted resources from administration to development work, introduced cabinet-style management and greatly improved coordination among the far-flung members of the United Nations family.
To reduce the built-in bias towards institutional inertia that has afflicted our work, and to facilitate the strategic redeployment of resources, I have proposed time limits or “sunset provisions” for initiatives involving new organizational structures or major commitments of funds.
The General Assembly has not yet accepted this proposal; I urge it to do so.
Furthermore, a more people-oriented United Nations must be a more results-based organization, both in its staffing and its allocation of resources.
We are making slow progress in the direction of a results-based budgeting system, one focused on outcomes rather than inputs and processes.
When fully implemented this will encourage greater efficiency and flexibility, while at the same time enhancing transparency and the Secretariat's accountability to Member States.
Here, too, the General Assembly's support is necessary.
To sum up, the United Nations of the twenty-first century must continue to be guided by its founding principles.
It must remain an Organization dedicated to the interests of its Member States and of their peoples.
Our objectives will not change: peace, prosperity, social justice and a sustainable future.
But the means we use to achieve those ends must be adapted to the challenges of the new era.
In future, the United Nations must increasingly serve as a catalyst for collective action, both among its Member States and between them and the vibrant constellation of new non-state actors.
We must continue to be the place where new standards of international conduct are hammered out, and broad consensus on them is established.
We must harness the power of technology to improve the fortunes of developing countries.
Finally, we ourselves, as an organization, must become more effective, efficient, and accessible to the world's peoples.
When we fail, we must be our own most demanding critics.
Only by these means can we become a global public trust for all the world's peoples.
For consideration by the Summit
The purposes and principles of the United Nations are set out clearly in the Charter, and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
The following values, which reflect the spirit of the Charter, are — I believe — shared by all nations, and are of particular importance for the age we are now entering:
Men and women have the right to live their lives and raise their children in dignity, free from hunger and squalor and from the fear of violence or oppression.
These rights are best assured by representative government, based on the will of the people.
Equity and solidarity.
No individual and no nation must be denied the opportunity to benefit from globalization.
Global risks must be managed in a way that shares the costs and burdens fairly.
Those who suffer, or who benefit least, are entitled to help from those who benefit most.
Human beings must respect each other, in all their diversity of faith, culture and language.
Differences within and between societies should be neither feared nor repressed, but cherished.
Disputes between and within nations should be resolved by peaceful means, except where use of force is authorized by the Charter.
Respect for nature.
Shared responsibility.
States must act together to maintain international peace and security, in accordance with the Charter.
The management of risks and threats that affect all the world's peoples should be considered multilaterally.
In applying these values to the new century, our priorities must be clear.
First, we must spare no effort to free our fellow men and women from the abject and dehumanizing poverty in which more than 1 billion of them are currently confined.
Let us resolve therefore:
• To halve, by the time this century is 15 years old, the proportion of the world's people (currently 22 per cent) whose income is less than one dollar a day.
• To halve, by the same date, the proportion of people (currently 20 per cent) who are unable to reach, or to afford, safe drinking water.
• That by the same date all children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling; and that girls and boys will have equal access to all levels of education.
• That by then we will have halted, and begun to reverse, the spread of HIV/AIDS.
• That, by 2020, we will have achieved significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers around the world.
• To develop strategies that will give young people everywhere the chance of finding decent work.
• To ensure that the benefits of new technology, especially information technology, are available to all.
• That every national government will from now on commit itself to national policies and programmes directed specifically at reducing poverty, to be developed and applied in consultation with civil society.
At the international level, the more fortunate countries owe a duty of solidarity to the less fortunate.
Let them resolve therefore:
• To grant free access to their markets for goods produced in poor countries — and, as a first step, to be prepared, at the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries in March 2001, to adopt a policy of duty-free and quota-free access for essentially all exports from the least developed countries.
• To remove the shackles of debt which currently keep many of the poorest countries imprisoned in their poverty — and, as first steps, to implement the expansion of the debt relief programme for heavily indebted poor countries agreed last year without further delay, and to be prepared to cancel all official debts of the heavily indebted poor countries, in return for those countries making demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction.
• To grant more generous development assistance, particularly to those countries which are genuinely applying their resources to poverty reduction.
• To work with the pharmaceutical industry and other partners to develop an effective and affordable vaccine against HIV; and to make HIV-related drugs more widely accessible in developing countries.
At both the national and international levels, private investment has an indispensable role to play.
Let us resolve therefore:
• To develop strong partnerships with the private sector to combat poverty in all its aspects.
Extreme poverty in sub-Saharan Africa affects a higher proportion of the population than in any other region.
It is compounded by a higher incidence of conflict, HIV/AIDS and many other ills.
Let us resolve therefore:
• That in all our efforts we will make special provision for the needs of Africa, and give our full support to Africans in their struggle to overcome the continent's problems.
For my part, I have announced four new initiatives in the course of this report:
• A Health InterNetwork, to provide hospitals and clinics in developing countries with access to up-to-date medical information.
• A United Nations Information Technology Service (UNITeS), to train groups in developing countries in the uses and opportunities of information technology.
• A disaster response initiative, “First on the Ground”, which will provide uninterrupted communications access to areas affected by natural disasters and emergencies.
• A global policy network to explore viable new approaches to the problem of youth employment.
Second, we must spare no effort to free our fellow men and women from the scourge of war — as the Charter requires us to do — and especially from the violence of civil conflict and the fear of weapons of mass destruction, which are the two great sources of terror in the present age.
Let us resolve therefore:
• To strengthen respect for law, in international as in national affairs, in particular the agreed provisions of treaties on the control of armaments, and international humanitarian and human rights law.
I invite all governments that have not done so to sign and ratify the various conventions, covenants and treaties which form the central corpus of international law.
• To make the United Nations more effective in its work of maintaining peace and security, notably by
• Strengthening the capacity of the United Nations to conduct peace operations.
• Adopting measures to make economic sanctions adopted by the Security Council less harsh on innocent populations, and more effective in penalizing delinquent rulers.
• To take energetic action to curb the illegal traffic in small arms, notably by
• Creating greater transparency in arms transfers.
• Supporting regional disarmament measures, such as the moratorium on the importing, exporting or manufacturing of light weapons in West Africa.
• Extending to other areas — especially post-conflict situations — the “weapons for goods” programmes that have worked well in Albania, El Salvador, Mozambique and Panama.
• To examine the possibility of convening a major international conference to identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers.
Third, we must spare no effort to free our fellow men and women, and above all our children and grandchildren, from the danger of living on a planet irredeemably spoilt by human activities, and whose resources can no longer provide for their needs.
Given the extraordinary risks humanity confronts, let us resolve:
• To adopt a new ethic of conservation and stewardship; and, as first steps:
• To adopt and ratify the Kyoto Protocol, so that it can enter into force by 2002, and to ensure that its goals are met, as a step towards reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.
• To consider seriously incorporating the United Nations system of “green accounting” into national accounts.
• To provide financial support for, and become actively engaged in, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment.
Finally, we must spare no effort to make the United Nations a more effective instrument in the hands of the world's peoples for pursuing all three of these priorities — the fight against poverty, ignorance and disease; the fight against violence and terror; and the fight against the degradation and destruction of our common home.
Let us resolve therefore:
• To reform the Security Council, in a way that both enables it to carry out its responsibilities more effectively and gives it greater legitimacy in the eyes of all the world's peoples.
• To ensure that the Organization is given the necessary resources to carry out its mandates.
• To ensure that the Secretariat makes best use of those resources in the interests of all Member States, by allowing it to adopt the best management practices and technologies available, and to concentrate on those tasks that reflect the current priorities of Member States.
• To give full opportunities to non-governmental organizations and other non-state actors to make their indispensable contribution to the Organization's work.
I believe that these priorities are clear, and that all these things are achievable if we have the will to achieve them.
For many of the priorities, strategies have already been worked out, and are summarized in this report.
For others, what is needed first is to apply our minds, our energies and our research budgets to an intensive quest for workable solutions.
No state and no organization can solve all these problems by acting alone.
Nor however, should any state imagine that others will solve them for it, if its own government and citizens do not apply themselves wholeheartedly to the task.
Building a twenty-first century safer and more equitable than the twentieth is a task that requires the determined efforts of every state and every individual.
In inspiring and coordinating those efforts, a renewed United Nations will have a vital and exalting role to play.

Report of the Secretary-General
Contents
I. Introduction
The General Assembly, in paragraph 3 (a) of its resolution 53/77 E of 4 December 1998, entitled “Small arms”, had requested the Secretary-General to seek the views of all Member States on the objective, scope, agenda, dates and venue of and preparatory work for an international conference on the illicit arms trade in all its aspects and to take into account those views as well as the views already expressed by them in their previous replies to the request of the Secretary-General for their views in accordance with paragraph 4 of Assembly resolution 52/38 J of 9 December 1997.
In pursuance of that request, a note verbale dated 20 January 1999 was addressed to all Member States inviting them to provide information on the subject.
The replies of Member States were made available in the report of the Secretary-General dated 20 August 1999 (A/54/260).
On 15 December 1999, by its resolution 54/54 V, entitled “Small arms”, the General Assembly decided to establish a preparatory committee for the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, open to participation by all States, which would hold no fewer than three sessions, the first session to be held in New York from 28 February to 3 March 2000.
In paragraph 8 of the same resolution, the General Assembly invited all Member States, in particular those that had not yet done so, in response to the Secretary-General's note verbale dated 20 January 1999, to communicate to the Secretary-General their views on the agenda and other relevant questions relating to the Conference.
In paragraph 9, the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to transmit the replies of Member States relevant to paragraph 8 to the Preparatory Committee.
In pursuance of paragraph 8 of resolution 54/54 V, a note verbale dated 31 January 2000 was transmitted to all Member States inviting them, if they had not done so, to communicate their views to the Secretary-General at the earliest possible date, and preferably by 18 February 2000.
The replies of Member States received to date are included in section II of the present addendum.

Argentina
A priority objective of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects should be to strengthen or formulate norms for combating the illicit trade and manufacture of small arms and light weapons and to promote a sense of responsibility among States with regard to the export, import and transit of these weapons.
Argentina believes that this goal can be achieved relatively easily since the international community is aware of the need to supplement individual and regional efforts with global measures.
In this respect Argentina supports the suggestions made in the report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Small Arms (A/54/258, part V).
It would also be important for the Conference to analyse the measures already adopted at the regional level, for example, the Inter-American Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, and Other Related Materials, the model regulations for the control of the international movement of firearms, their parts, components and ammunition, adopted by the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission of the Organization of American States, and the Declaration signed by the Presidents of the member States of the Common Market of the Southern Cone, and of Bolivia and Chile, in April 1998, on the basis of which it was agreed that a joint register mechanism of buyers and sellers of those items would be created.
Another measure which the Conference should promote is the early entry into force of the protocol on firearms of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime which would establish, inter alia, a centralized international register on the illicit manufacture of and trafficking in firearms, ammunition, explosives and related materials.
It would be desirable for individual States to align their legislation with the conclusions and recommendations which emerge from this Conference and to establish the foundations for the effective implementation of internationally agreed mechanisms for greater cooperation in this area.
In this respect, it is essential for the Conference to encourage true coordination of policies and efforts and the harmonization of national legislation.
It could be useful to request Member States to make available to the Preparatory Committee a copy of their national provisions on the regulation, registration and control of firearms, and to indicate whether they possess a computerized national system of data on firearms, and also the controls placed on arms exports and imports and the checks made before releasing them into the market.
It would also be worth requesting Member States to provide to the Preparatory Committee, if available, statistics on offences or crimes committed with small arms or light weapons, hostile activities in their territories, and patterns of crime, specifying the type of weapons held by risk groups, etc.
Canada views the decision of the General Assembly in paragraph 1 of resolution 54/54 V to convene the Conference as important to further aid and enhance international efforts to deal effectively with the problems posed by the excessive and destabilizing accumulations and uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons.
In Canada's view, a successful outcome for the Conference would be the acceptance of a meaningful action plan, with a timetable for implementation, that will actually reduce the numbers of small arms and light weapons in circulation throughout the world, prevent problematic transfers, promote transparency and reduce the role of small arms and light weapons in undermining human security through exacerbating armed conflict, perpetrating gross violations of human rights and destabilizing societies.
The action plan accepted at the Conference should: (a) include “supply-side” measures, these principally being agreed standards for State behaviour, as well as assistance in implementing them at the global, regional and national levels; (b) include “demand-side” measures, which are generally initiatives designed to help affected States and regions to collect and destroy existing and unwanted small arms and light weaponry from their territories and communities; (c) promote responsibility and restraint by States with regard to the export, import, transfer and production of small arms and light weapons; (d) develop agreed norms for the security and the safe management of stockpiles of small arms and light weapons held by State authorities or State-authorized authorities; and (e) elaborate a universal norm that calls for the destruction of all small arms that States or State-authorized entities have seized or confiscated as a result of interdicting illicit traffic or collected through disarmament and demobilization activities and/or are held by States or State-authorized entities in excess of legitimate defence needs.
Canada believes that the scope of the Conference should cover all aspects of the problems associated with the excessive and destabilizing accumulation and uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons.
In particular, the Preparatory Committee of the Conference should not limit itself to the illicit transfers of small arms and light weapons, but should recognize in its work the interrelationship that exists between illicit trafficking and the licit trade in small arms and light weapons.
In this respect, the work of the Preparatory Committee and of the Conference itself should not duplicate the ongoing work in the context of the Economic and Social Council to elaborate a protocol to combat the illicit manufacturing of and illicit trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.
Indeed, Canada views the work of the Preparatory Committee and the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Elaboration of a Convention against Transnational Organized Crime as being complementary and mutually reinforcing.
Canada notes that the responsibility of setting the agenda and timetable for the Conference will fall to the Preparatory Committee.
Canada's view is that the Preparatory Committee should identify as the primary agenda item for the Conference the acceptance of the meaningful action plan, with timetable for implementation, referred to above.
This means that the principal task of the Preparatory Committee will be to develop the action plan in time for its acceptance at the Conference.
Canada is committed to contribute and participate during the Preparatory Committee process to help ensure that the Preparatory Committee can achieve this important objective.
Canada encourages non-governmental organizations and representatives of civil society to take an active interest in the preparatory process.
In this respect, Canada supports an active role for civil society and believes that representatives of civil society should have appropriate opportunities to convey their views and perspectives to the Preparatory Committee and ultimately to the Conference itself.
Thailand supports the convening of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects in 2001 and views the Conference as an opportunity for the consideration of international action/measures to tackle the problems of the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons in a more systematic manner.
Thailand hopes that the Conference will be able to reach tangible measures or at least a joint political declaration regarding this problem.
Although the problem of small arms has a multifaceted dimension involving security and disarmament, as well as law enforcement, the objective and scope of the Conference should focus only on the illicit aspect of the problems of small arms and related issues rather than issues that have already been discussed in the Ad Hoc Committee on the Elaboration of a Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, including the draft protocol on firearms.
In this connection, Thailand wishes to propose the following agenda to be discussed at the 2001 Conference:
- The prevention and eradication of the illicit production, trade and transfer of small arms, bearing in mind the sovereignty of States in protecting national security;
- National mechanisms and international cooperation in solving the problems of small arms.
Thailand welcomes the offer by Switzerland to host the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.
However, in selecting the venue of the Conference, it is imperative to ensure the widest possible and effective participation in the Conference in 2001, as stipulated in paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 54/54 V.

Introduction
India supports the convening of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.
India participated actively in the work of the Preparatory Committee in New York in early 2000.
India intends to contribute actively to the study by the Secretary-General requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 14 of its resolution 54/54 V, on the feasibility of restricting the manufacture and trade of small arms and light weapons to the manufacturers and dealers authorized by States.
India believes that this study, which will cover brokering activities, particularly illicit activities, relating to small arms and light weapons, would be an important input to the Conference.
India is also participating actively in the negotiations in Vienna on a draft protocol against the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, ammunition and other related materials, in the context of the proposed United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.
Complementarity with other initiatives
The negotiations in Vienna, covering as they do an important strand of the problem — criminality of illicit manufacturing and trafficking — should be seen as a complementary process to the shared objective of fostering international cooperation in combating illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.
The Conference to be held in 2001 is a useful opportunity to broaden what has been achieved in Vienna to cover, as appropriate, not only all small arms and light weapons as opposed to civilian firearms, but also transfers by Governments.
India has closely followed and supported the work of the first panel of governmental experts that resulted in the 1997 report of the Secretary-General on small arms (A/52/298, annex).
We believe that the 1997 report, as well as its 1999 follow-up (A/54/258), covered substantial ground, clarifying essential issues and generating agreement on measures to tackle the phenomenon of illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.
Useful contributions have also been made in the reports of the Secretary-General relating to the problem of ammunition and explosives (A/54/155) and on the feasibility of carrying out a study on restricting the manufacture and trade of small arms to manufacturers and dealers authorized by States (A/54/160).
The efforts of the international community are also reflected in the work of the Disarmament Commission, in particular its guidelines for international arms transfers1 and the more recent guidelines drawn up in 1999.2 India believes that these efforts have continued validity and the measures suggested or the definitions used by them could assist the work of the Conference to be held in 2001.
A number of regional initiatives on various aspects of this problem, including ways and means of ending the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and their reduction in post-conflict situations, have been taken.
India believes that regional efforts, by their very nature, do not address the global nature of sourcing of small arms and light weapons and the increasingly transnational networks of brokers, dealers, financiers and transporters.
They often do not address transfers by Governments and serve merely as a mechanism for facilitating the regional cooperation of law enforcement agencies.
Even in this latter aspect, experience of implementation is limited and already problems of insufficient state capacity are visible.
More important, some regions have not been able to build regional norms and frameworks for cooperation given well-known political constraints and therefore need an international framework to address the problem of the proliferation of small arms and light weapons.
This is not, however, an either/or situation.
The Conference needs to borrow and build upon elements from regional experience, and the regional initiatives would need the supporting international framework expected to be provided by the Conference.
The Conference should also help harmonize regional and global norms that help us to identify over time what is licit and what is not.
Objectives of the Conference
The objectives of the Conference should be to strengthen international efforts to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and, in this regard, to raise awareness and galvanize political will in the international community.
The Conference should also foster the development, on a sustainable basis, of a globally applicable norm against the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects.
By resolution 54/54 V, the General Assembly has defined the scope of the Conference as the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects.
India believes that much of the trade in small arms and light weapons consists of legal transfers to meet the legitimate needs of States for self-defence, maintenance of internal peace and security and securing conditions for the peaceful socio-economic development of their peoples and the ability to participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The dividing line between licit trade for legitimate security requirements of both individuals and States and classic contraband approaches is, however, not clear.
The Conference should also adopt an integrated approach to ammunition and explosives.
Small arms do not kill; they are merely delivery systems for ammunition and explosives.
In many cases, control over small arms and light weapons would only be possible if control over ammunition is ensured.
Therefore, a narrower approach will be self-defeating.
While noting a comprehensive and integrated approach is required to security and development, India believes that the deliberations of the Conference should strike a judicious balance between a pure disarmament approach that focuses on control and reductions of small arms and light weapons, and a contextual approach.
There is a concern that implementing political, as opposed to arms control, standards in the context of comprehensive approaches could place a heavier burden on developing countries.
Therefore the treatment of contextual issues should be limited to those aspects of the multifaceted problem of small arms proliferation that need to be tackled as a first priority.
The priority for international action, India believes, lies in combating the close link between small arms proliferation, international terrorism, trafficking in drugs, organized crime and money-laundering and the “grey markets” that feed this link.
Final documents
The Conference should adopt a declaration as well as substantive documents, including an international programme of action containing agreed measures at both the national and international levels.
The programme of action may not contain legally binding undertakings but could lead to such undertakings and should certainly provide the basis for further substantive consideration and follow-up action by the international community.
Once States commit themselves in the Declaration to extending control over all parts of the small arms and light weapons chain, the Conference could proceed to the identification of specific measures in the programme of action that could be supplemented by appropriate transparency and confidence-building measures.
India also believes that the Conference documents should provide for measures that promote cooperation and consultation.
The agenda of the Conference should be practical and oriented towards a substantive outcome.
It should allow for flexibility for the Conference to deal with all aspects of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.
Rules of procedure
In deciding on the draft rules of procedure for the Conference, Member States must keep in mind that the success of the Conference will be judged by its ability to generate the widest possible consensus among participating States in order to ensure, over the long term, the positive impact of its recommendations.
While the obligations flowing from the Conference must not dilute its primary character as a Conference of States, meaningful contributions can be made as observers from the specialized agencies and other relevant intergovernmental organizations having received a standing invitation to participate in the work of the General Assembly, as well as relevant non-governmental organizations admitted on the basis of agreed criteria for attendance as observers in the open meetings of the Preparatory Committee and the Conference.
Other issues
In terms of venue for subsequent meetings of the Preparatory Committee and the Conference itself, India would be guided by the importance of ensuring effective participation by all States, consistent with the position of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries on the issue.

[Original: Spanish] [18 August 2000]
The Government of the Republic of Cuba wishes to reiterate the positions stated in notes it previously sent to the Secretary-General in pursuance of resolutions 52/38 J and 53/77 E.
We commend the efforts of the international community to combat illicit trade in small arms and light weapons although we continue to think that it would be more effective if, at the appropriate time, we were to attack the problem of illicit traffic in all kinds of weapons.
Criminal activities in the arms trade generally follow a common pattern regardless of the type of weapon involved in that they are manufactured and trafficked in violation of arms control laws and regulations.
It is essential to honour the mandate conferred on the Conference by the General Assembly with regard to the scope of the Conference, namely, “Illicit trade in all its aspects”, since we feel that the more the debate deviates from that mandate, the more difficult it will be to achieve widely accepted results.
It is undeniable that while small arms and light weapons are major agents in some internal conflicts, with their known disastrous effect on the civilians of those areas, they also constitute an important component of the self-defence of many countries.
In accordance with that principle, States have a legitimate right to acquire and possess such arms.
Consequently, the United Nations Conference on illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects should adhere to the principle that legal traffic in such arms deserves the same respect as the principles enshrined in the Charter.
Cuba considers that States have a vital role to play in dealing with illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.
While the United Nations unquestionably has a responsibility to adopt global means at the international level, it is the responsibility of the States to serve as the chief actors in the regulation and control of the weapons they possess.
It is up to the authorities of each country to assume primary responsibility for taking the most appropriate measures to regulate and control arms in their respective territories.
Logically, every State is sovereign, and equally entitled to the help it requires to perform those functions and the international community should search for a way or the mechanisms by which to ensure that such assistance will be available when requested.
Cuba is prepared to cooperate in exploring such ways and means.
Small arms and light weapons constitute the sole means of defence of most countries in the world and for some States, they are simply one more category of weapons in their arsenal, which includes weapons of mass destruction.
This implies that the impact of this type of weapons on the national security concerns of each country is different.
It would be irresponsible not to acknowledge that reality.
As Cuba sees it, the 2001 Conference will be the framework for agreement on formulas that instead of sharpening mistrust among States, will help to promote international cooperation in the struggle against the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects.
The Conference will have to find a way for States to exchange useful information voluntarily to cope with illicit traffic; it will have to set off a bilateral and multilateral dialogue among neighbouring States seeking regional solutions with a view to reaching mutually beneficial agreements.
States will have to pledge that they will not adopt any restrictive trade measures that impede the transfer of useful technologies aimed at combating illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.
The Conference should propose global measures which can later be adapted to regional and subregional conditions and situations.
Above all, the Conference will have to promote a regional and subregional approach to the problem of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons capable of providing more effective measures suited to the distinctive characteristics of each region or subregion.
The Conference should reach out to the various existing regional and subregional institutions and suggest initiatives they can take to implement the recommendations of the Conference at a later stage by taking more specific measures.
At the same time, Cuba wishes to reiterate its position to the effect that unless we deal in depth with the causes of underdevelopment and poverty, we will fail to arrive at stable and lasting solutions to the problem of illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects.
Consequently, the 2001 Conference should adopt concrete measures to ensure that the resources released by disarmament are channelled to the development of the underdeveloped countries, primarily those emerging from armed conflicts.

Report of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization
Implementation of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations related to assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions
Report of the Secretary-General
Contents
Views communicated by Governments regarding the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting on assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions
Bulgaria, being among the countries most seriously affected as a result of the implementation of the Security Council resolutions imposing sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), Iraq and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, attaches particular importance to the issue of the implementation of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations related to assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions.
Bulgaria has repeatedly supported the opinion that the application of certain measures adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter should be accompanied by efforts for avoiding negative effects on third States or, where those effects have nevertheless taken place, for assisting such States promptly and effectively.
To that end, Bulgaria has continuously supported the need to establish an appropriate mechanism for rendering assistance to sanctions-affected third States.
Bulgaria recalls that the question of the implementation of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations related to assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions imposed under Chapter VII of the Charter has been discussed extensively in the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization and the Sixth Committee of the General Assembly, resulting in the adoption by consensus of resolutions 50/51, 51/208, 52/162 and 53/107.
Although the adoption of those resolutions and the provisions contained therein marked a distinct advance in identifying the core aspects of the problem, the need to address more specifically and directly the special economic problems of third States affected by sanctions imposed under Chapter VII of the Charter is still pending.
In that regard, Bulgaria commends the report of the Secretary-General on the subject (A/53/312), which contains a summary of the deliberations and main findings of the ad hoc expert group meeting convened pursuant to paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 52/162.
Bulgaria considers that the conclusions and recommendations of the ad hoc expert group contained in the report represent a good basis for identifying concrete further steps and measures for addressing the issues related to: (a) developing a possible methodology for assessing the consequences actually incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures imposed under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; and (b) exploring innovative and practical measures of assistance that could be provided to the affected third States by the relevant organizations both within and outside the United Nations system.
With regard to the development of a possible methodology, Bulgaria draws particular attention to the idea of elaborating a general conceptual framework for impact analysis for identifying and assessing the effects of United Nations-imposed preventive and enforcement measures on third States, which has been discussed extensively by the ad hoc expert group.
In that regard, Bulgaria states that the group's deliberations on issues and procedures related to the identification and proper categorization of various effects, the selection of applicable methods for estimating the incurred losses and costs, and subsequently the design of feasible and practical measures of relief and international assistance are commendable and deserve careful analysis and examination.
In the opinion of Bulgaria, the recommendation of having an advance assessment of the potential impact of sanctions on the target country and on third States before adopting a resolution under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations (para.
The devising of an appropriate mechanism for monitoring the effects of sanctions, once they have been imposed, is also considered important (para.
Regarding the second key issue of the ad hoc expert group meeting, namely, exploring innovative and practical measures of international assistance that could be provided to third States affected by the application of sanctions, Bulgaria supports the view that the concept of burden-sharing and equitable distribution of costs, as reflected in Articles 49 and 50 of the Charter of the United Nations, should be fully taken into account (paras. 36 and 37).
Bulgaria is of the view that the creation of a special contingency standby fund which would be activated in case of the imposition of sanctions by the Security Council deserves careful consideration.
Bulgaria recognizes the important role of the United Nations development programmes and specialized agencies in providing emergency relief and longer-term assistance to the affected third States to enable them to better cope with the social and humanitarian effects of sanctions, as well as in mobilizing support from donor countries and relevant organizations for these activities (para.
45). From Bulgaria's standpoint, the suggestion by the ad hoc expert group that serious consideration be given to applying, for the purpose of mitigating the adverse effects of sanctions on third States, the funding procedures similar to those adopted for peacekeeping operations (para. 46) deserves careful attention and analysis.
Bulgaria attaches particular importance to the need to ensure an appropriate mechanism for close coordination among all relevant institutions involved in providing assistance to the affected third States in case of the imposition of sanctions.
In that regard, the recommendation of the ad hoc expert group that in the most severe cases, the Secretary-General should appoint a Special Representative to undertake, in collaboration with the Governments concerned, a full assessment of the consequences actually incurred by the specially affected countries as a result of carrying out the United Nations-imposed sanctions, and to identify appropriate and adequate measures of assistance to such States (para.
54) is particularly commendable. In addition, Bulgaria feels that the idea of creating a standing Security Council sanctions committee for assessing and monitoring on a permanent basis the political, social, economic and humanitarian impact of sanctions may also be considered.
In the opinion of Bulgaria, the ideas of providing special or preferential treatment for the suppliers from sanctions-affected non-target States, facilitating the participation of companies from such States in international efforts for post-conflict rehabilitation, reconstruction and development and promoting foreign direct investment in their economies also deserve special consideration.
On the whole, Bulgaria considers that the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting, together with the views expressed in the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization and the Sixth Committee of the General Assembly, as well as the provisions of relevant General Assembly resolutions, constitute a sound basis for finalizing the work on this very important issue by reaching an agreement acceptable to all parties on practical solutions concerning the implementation of Article 50 of the Charter.
In this regard, Bulgaria believes that the political will of Member States is particularly important.
Turkey provided its views comprising: (a) information regarding the consequences incurred by Turkey as a third State affected by the application of sanctions imposed on Iraq; and (b) a general evaluation of the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting convened pursuant to paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 52/162.
It states that the issue of the implementation of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations related to assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions, having its place among the agenda items of utmost importance, is closely followed by the Government of the Republic of Turkey.
The particular interest of Turkey concerning this item arises from the fact that Turkey, as a third State, has incurred considerable consequences of the sanctions applied by the United Nations.
The sanctions, in particular those imposed on Iraq, have had substantial effects on the Turkish economy.
The difficulties that emerged as a consequence of the severance of gross bilateral trade between Turkey and Iraq, the termination of contracting and banking services, the loss of transportation and communication fees, the halt of tourism from and through Iraq, the cessation of regional commercial activities, and the military expenditures for struggling with terrorism originating in northern Iraq have reached intolerable limits for Turkey.
In that regard, Turkey estimates that the total loss to its economy has surpassed $35 billion as a result of the following causes: (a) suspension of the operation until the end of 1996 of the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik crude oil pipeline, from which Turkey not only was procuring a remarkable portion of its oil import, but also was obtaining a transit fee of $250 million per annum; (b) termination of the transportation activities to and from Iraq that had been carried out by approximately 12,000 trucks with Turkish licence plates; (c) loss of the free-of-charge transit through Iraq to the Gulf States and the fact that Turkish vehicles are compelled to pay excessive transit fees to other States in order to continue transportation to the Gulf States; (d) departure from Iraq, without even the opportunity to take their equipment with them, of Turkish contractors who had undertaken huge projects in that country before the Gulf war; (e) forfeiture of credits from Iraq to the Turkish Central Bank (around $1 billion), the Turkish Eximbank, commercial banks and companies; (f) the concentration of about 500,000 refugees at the Turkish border with Iraq following the Gulf war and the military expenditures for the prevention of terrorism, which expanded in the absence of authority in northern Iraq.
The sanctions imposed on Iraq have mostly affected the economy of the south-eastern Anatolia region; the income sources of the region, particularly stock-breeding, the transportation industry and border commerce, have waned and thousands of enterprises have gone out of business.
Turkey, as a State which has encountered the adverse effects of the application of sanctions imposed on other States, expects that the deliberations within the relevant United Nations institutions will be concluded, and that a functional mechanism will be established, with respect to the issue of assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions.
Turkey considers that the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting on developing a methodology for assessing the consequences incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures and on exploring innovative and practical measures of international assistance to the affected third States (A/53/312, sect. IV) provides a basis for attaining concrete results.
In particular, Turkey believes that the parts of the report grouping various types of effects as direct and indirect, trade-related and financial, economic and social, primary and secondary, temporary and long-lasting (paras.
34), and the conclusions and recommendations (paras.
49-57) put forward remarkable observations.
In the opinion of Turkey, one of the crucial aspects of assessing the effects of sanctions on third States is taking into account the intensity of economic relations and other (e.g., geographical) factors in place between the target country and the third State.
Moreover, it is expected that certain mechanisms already established for the restitution of the damages caused by the target State, like the United Nations Compensation Commission concerning Iraq, will be revitalized and become functional to achieve their essential purposes.
In that regard, Turkey recommends the following additional points as further mechanisms to activate the work regarding assistance to third States affected by sanctions:
(a) It is observed that commercial exemptions or concessions granted to certain neighbouring countries have proved to be the most effective and practical method of affording relief to the third States which have intensive commercial relations with the target State.
This was the case when one of Iraq's neighbouring countries, which cited the crises that its economy had undergone owing to the sanctions, was authorized to sign a trade protocol to import circa 3.5 million tons of oil and oil products from Iraq.
In paragraph 40 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/53/312), several examples are given regarding the exemptions granted to neighbouring and other third countries.
However, the application, consideration and decision-making procedures with respect to granting exemptions to third States are not elaborated on the same report.
In this context, as an effective method of resolving problems of third States stemming from the implementation of sanctions, it could be recommended that third States, particularly neighbouring countries which have intensive commercial and economic relations with the target State subject to the sanctions regime, be permitted, on an exceptional basis, to continue the trade of specific commodities and services.
In addition, the procedure regarding application for, consideration of and deciding on these exemptions should be clearly set forth for the convenience of third States.
(b) Another way which would contribute to providing assistance to third States affected by sanctions is directly asking their views on the issue.
Thus, the third States which have been affected by sanctions would have an opportunity to state in the proper forums the actual impacts of sanctions on their national economies and to suggest applicable ways to reduce the adverse effects arising from the implementation of sanctions.
Such a mechanism, being envisioned also in paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 53/107 of 8 December 1998, would facilitate the work of special fact-finding or evaluation missions (para.
56) and that of the Secretariat to be entrusted with the task of monitoring the effects of sanctions with a view to providing information to the Security Council (para.
(c) A crucial point in the implementation of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations related to assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions is the occurrence of special circumstances which might put some third States in a position of urgent need for certain items.
For example, a third State might have the necessity to receive immediately certain commodities or energy inputs, including oil and oil products, due to a natural disaster or other unforeseen events of a similar nature.
If such a third State is a neighbouring country, providing the necessary material from the target State could even become a vital solution.
In such cases, the special needs of the affected third State should be assessed on a priority basis and the strict application of sanctions should be waived, where necessary.
(d) Although under many sanctions regimes overall trade with the target State is suspended, certain investment, construction, commercial and other economic activities, particularly for humanitarian purposes, may continue to take place between the target State and other States.
Humanitarian assistance to the target State in such forms as providing medical equipment, reconstruction of medical facilities and the “oil-for-food programme” in Iraq are examples of this kind.
In providing commodities and services for this purpose, the contractors could be selected from those States which have incurred the bulk of adverse effects stemming from the application of sanctions.
Such a selection would contribute to alleviating the economic burden of implementing sanctions by the most seriously affected third States.
Yemen1 communicated information on the adverse consequences that the country has incurred as a result of its compliance with the sanctions regime imposed on Iraq.
In that connection, the competent authorities in the Republic of Yemen have reported that there are a number of Iraqi ships (eight oil tankers and five freighters) that have been moored in the port of Aden since the end of the war between Iraq and Kuwait.
The presence of those ships has been inordinately costly, owing to the fact that they have had to be maintained and supplied with fuel, water and other necessary stores and, of course, their crews have had to be kept provisioned as well.
Moreover, they constitute a permanent hazard owing to corrosion, the leakage of fuel from them and the fact that they take up a good deal of space, impeding the movement of ships in the port.
In view of these facts, Yemen requested that the matter be referred to the competent United Nations authority with a view to either empowering the Government of the Republic of Yemen without delay to take measures to solve the problem or else granting it compensation for the damage and expense which it incurs by allowing the ships to remain in the port of Aden indefinitely in the absence of a solution.2

Recalling Security Council resolutions 687 (1991) of 3 April 1991 and 689 (1991) of 9 April 1991, by which the Council decided to establish the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission and to review the question of its termination or continuation every six months,

Reaffirming that the costs of the Observation Mission that are not covered by voluntary contributions are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,
Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Observation Mission, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,
Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,
Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,
Expressing its appreciation for the substantial voluntary contributions made to the Observation Mission by the Government of Kuwait and the contributions of other Governments,

I. Introduction
The present report is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 54/249 by which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit a report to the Assembly at its fifty-fourth session on the administrative and financial issues concerning the Non-Governmental Organizations Section, in particular with regard to the number and level of posts in the Section.
In the same resolution, the General Assembly decided, inter alia, to reclassify the post of the Chief of the Section to D-1, noted the rapid development of the partnership between the United Nations and the non-governmental organization (NGO) community and recognized the increased workload of the Section.
The present report supplements the earlier report on the same subject which was submitted to the General Assembly in November 1999 (A/54/520). The activities of the Non-Governmental Organizations Section and the significant increase in its workload and level of responsibility are described in detail in that report.
The information contained in that report is still fully valid and relevant and has not been repeated in the present report.
For this reason, the present report deals only with the staffing requirements of the Section.
The staffing resources of the Non-Governmental Organizations Section funded by the regular budget include five Professional (one D-1, two P-4, one P-3 and one P-2) and four General Service posts.
In addition, the Section has been utilizing on a regular basis the services of volunteers equivalent to approximately 60 work-months annually, of which 20 are at the Professional and 40 at the General Service level.
In order to carry out its programme of work more efficiently and with a view to optimizing the contribution and participation of NGOs in the work of the United Nations, it is considered that the current staff resources of the Section would need to be increased on an annual basis by 12 work-months at the Professional level and 12 work-months at the General Service level.
The table below shows how the staff work-months from all sources of funding currently available to the Section and the additional work-months of staff resources needed to carry out the work programme of the Section would be distributed between the main areas of work of the Section on an annual basis.
The Non-Governmental Organizations Section has obtained some temporary relief through the redeployment of a P-3 staff member from another area of work of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs for only a few months in 2000.
Efforts to obtain additional relief at the General Service level are still ongoing.
The assistance provided to the Section by volunteers or even by regular budget staff on secondment for short periods of time has reached a point beyond which further increases would have a serious negative effect on the work of the Section.
Continued heavy reliance on voluntary arrangements and the use of short-term staff would bring further discontinuities and instability as well as a loss of accumulated experience and institutional memory.
Such factors are especially important in NGO accreditation work because of precedents and issues that may arise in the Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations and the Economic and Social Council.
In order to achieve a better balance between available and required staff resources and between permanent staff and volunteers, it is proposed to establish one new Professional post at the P-4 level and one new General Service post.
The established staffing table of the Section would then comprise six Professional posts (one D-1, three P-4, one P-3 and one P-2) and five General Service posts.
The functions of the P-4 post would involve reviewing and processing new applications from NGOs applying for consultative status with the Economic and Social Council and ensuring that they are submitted in accordance with the provisions and guidelines of Council resolution 1996/31; substantive servicing of the Committee on NGOs; assistance in the design of new guidelines and arrangements as part of the outreach programme to facilitate participation of NGOs in the work of the Economic and Social Council and broaden their working relationship with the United Nations system; and support to the launch and implementation of the special projects of the Section, in particular, the establishment of the NGO regional networks, and collaborative projects with the United Nations Development Programme and other organizations of the United Nations system.
This will involve work on the design of strategies to develop training plans, programmes and materials with special emphasis on the needs of NGOs in developing countries and countries with economies in transition.
The General Service post would entail functions largely concerned with updating and maintaining the NGO electronic network as an enhanced technical capacity for using new computer and information systems, to support both outreach and coordination functions within the NGO section, in response to Economic and Social Council resolution 1996/31.
Additional functions of the post would include operation of databases integral to the work of the Section, analyses of database requirements and evaluating the adequacy of existing NGO-related information tools.
The functions of the post would also entail strengthening the information management and dissemination activities of the Section through the use of modern information technology and assisting in the development of a comprehensive approach to an integrated system regarding the participation of NGOs in the work of the Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies.
In order to meet the Secretariat mandate of ensuring the contribution and participation of an ever-increasing number of NGOs in the work of the United Nations in accordance with the decisions of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, it is proposed that the Non-Governmental Organizations Section be strengthened through the establishment of one Professional post at the P-4 level and one General Service post.
The addition of these two posts would enable the Section to carry out more efficiently its regular workload and special projects (the details of which are contained in chapters II and III of document A/54/520).
The two posts would also increase the capacity of the Section to retain its accumulated experience and institutional memory.
Should the General Assembly approve the establishment of one P-4 and one General Service post, as of 1 January 2001, additional requirements (costed at rates for new posts) of $105,600 would arise under section 9, Economic and social affairs of the programme budget for 2000-2001.
Further additional requirements would also arise under section 32, Staff assessment ($19,300) to be offset by an equivalent amount of $19,300 under income section 1, Income from staff assessment.
These requirements would be reflected as a charge to the contingency fund in the context of the first performance report, which will be submitted to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session.

Introduction
The United Nations Foundation (UNF) will make grants to the United Nations system of approximately $20 million per year in support of projects to improve children's health.
Depending on one's perspective, this is either a tremendous amount of money or a drop in the proverbial bucket.
Either way, the money has the greatest potential to better the health of many children if it is invested so as to promote lasting change, such as strengthening the public health system or forever ridding the world of a disease like polio.
The Foundation has a unique opportunity to promote such long-term change by working to support the activities of the United Nations.
The United Nations has strong technical professionals, builds upon years of established work with countries, and has unparalleled access to national Governments that expect the United Nations to be a partner for years to come.
Strengthening the United Nations ability to improve the health of children is likely to benefit children today as well as children born in future years.
For those children, the United Nations must continue to adapt to a changing world that will likely include decentralized Governments, more involvement by non-governmental organizations and other private sector organizations, and difficult challenges posed by countries in conflict.
The Programme Framework Group (PFG) on children's health has considered these perspectives in selecting preventive health areas to recommend for UNF support.
It has also taken into account the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children, and the Plan of Action for Implementing the Declaration, adopted by the World Summit for Children.
The overarching consideration has been to identify specific and unique niches in which UNF support can truly bring about a catalytic change to decrease child mortality and strengthen the public health system.
A focus on strengthening the public health systems in selected countries will likely provide benefits that extend beyond the current framework.
Polio is one of the few diseases that can be eradicated, provides a unique public health opportunity for the Foundation to make a lasting contribution to humanity.
Eradication is anticipated by 2000, with active global surveillance efforts through 2005 to ensure that the world is truly rid of the disease.
The final stages of polio eradication are the most difficult and costly, because the remaining countries pose unique challenges, including internal conflicts.
The Foundation will take on a partnership flagship role to raise additional sector funds to support the eradication initiative.
Tobacco is the single most lethal agent known to humanity _ more people die of tobacco-related diseases each year than from any bacteria or virus.
Tobacco companies continue to successfully market their addictive products to children (particularly in developing countries); 90 per cent of those who smoke begin doing so before their eighteenth birthday.
UNF support would help to spread knowledge of the relevant Minnesota (United States) lawsuit to the global community; “taxation for health” policies to increase the price of tobacco products, thereby decreasing consumption; and media/education initiatives that would involve adolescents in developing counter-advertisements.
Child mortality
Efforts to reduce child mortality continue to be a high priority for the developing world.
In order to promote the greatest decrease in child mortality, UNF support will be targeted in four areas, described below, and will be focused on a selected number of countries.
The HIV/AIDS epidemic has the potential to nullify many of the achievements in child survival.
UNF support would seek to prevent transmission of HIV to youth by promoting voluntary, confidential testing and counselling; determining the best infant feeding options for HIV-infected mothers; and developing youth-oriented HIV prevention communication messages that involve youth as active partners.
Specific attention will be given to building partnerships with the private sector and World Bank.
Adequate dietary micronutrients (i.e., vitamins and trace elements) can dramatically decrease child mortality/morbidity.
UNF support would: facilitate micronutrient delivery by encouraging private sector partnerships to modify staple foods (e.g., rice, wheat, flour, noodles); evaluate zinc's potential to decrease mortality and morbidity (possibly from diarrhoea, respiratory diseases, and malaria); and work towards clarifying the link between lack of micronutrients and low-birth-weight babies, who are more likely to become ill and die.
(Reducing low birth rate is a priority in the Plan of Action adopted by the World Summit for Children.
Vaccines are one of the most cost-effective preventive health measures for decreasing child mortality.
However, vaccine coverage rates in some countries are unacceptably low (in the range of 30 per cent, rather than the desired 80 per cent).
Through community outreach, the Foundation would seek to combat a major cause of child mortality in some developing countries _ namely, the community's lack of knowledge of when to seek health care for an ill child, whether (or what) to feed an ill child, and how to administer medications to an ill child.
This outreach would occur in the context of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses initiative.
Expected outcomes
Strengthened public health infrastructure/ capacity at the community and national levels to prevent disease and address the health needs of populations in selected countries
Reduced childhood mortality, near eradication of polio, and increased awareness and knowledge of tobacco's adverse health effects
I. United Nations Fund for International Partnerships/United Nations Foundation programme framework on children's health: enhancing the global public health system via selected preventive health strategies
A. The programme framework rationale
The United Nations Foundation expects to provide approximately $20 million per year to support United Nations efforts to improve children's health. (The total amount of requested support during each annual funding cycle is expected to exceed that amount.
) This funding is highly limited in relation to total United Nations programmes relating to children's health issues and to the even larger challenges and resource needs identified in the World Declaration and Plan of Action adopted by the World Summit for Children.
In order to maximize the impact of the Foundation's assistance, the UNF Board has stipulated that support should focus sharply and strategically on a narrow set of objectives and programmes.
While UNF funding cannot be expected to resolve children's health issues on a global scale, if used strategically it can foster major progress in identifying and testing policies and programmatic approaches that address those issues.
Moreover, by demonstrating effective policies and programmatic approaches and sharing successful experiences with others, activities supported with UNF funding could help to create the conditions that will accelerate progress towards global implementation of the World Declaration and Plan of Action of the World Summit for Children.
Resources for large-scale expansions would likely need to come primarily from countries themselves, perhaps with support from major lending and grant-making institutions as well as from the private sector, rather than from UNF.
B. Goals of the framework process
The Programme Framework Group (PFG) on children's health met for the first time on 3 and 4 March 1999 to discuss and prioritize selected areas for UNF funding.
On 1 April, the Group met again to refine further the priority areas and discuss measurable and achievable outcomes for the framework.
The framework development process took the following into account:
(a) Children's health — preventing common and serious diseases among children and reducing risk factors for disease as children become adults (such as tobacco use);
(b) Opportunities to strengthen the public health infrastructure;
(c) UNF priorities (to facilitate partnerships, “tell the story” of the United Nations successful accomplishments, and raise additional resources in support of United Nations causes);
(d) The World Declaration and Plan of Action of the World Summit for Children;
(e) Lessons learned and replication of best practices;
(f) Likely short-term successes (such as polio eradication) and laying the groundwork for possible future successes;
(g) Overlapping with and thus possibly enhancing activities in the UNF programmes on population and women.
The table provides an overview of the selected health areas of emphasis.
Within each health area, specific and well-defined priorities have been identified for support.
This document describes those areas in detail.
The PFG also noted that UNF resources could be used to help facilitate rapid, joint action in the United Nations system and thereby provide an opportunity for the system to work in a more flexible and responsive manner.
The participants in the PFG were:
Dr. Awa Marie Coll-Seck Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/ AIDS (UNAIDS)
Dr. Nicholas Dodd
United Nations Population Fund Dr. David Alnwick
United Nations Children's Fund Dr. James Tulloch
World Health Organization Dr. Anthony Measham
Dr. Dory Storms Johns Hopkins University
United Nations Foundation
Ms. Chandi Kadirgamar United Nations Fund for International Partnerships
C. Priority areas of the framework
The three-year framework is oriented in terms of preventing disease and risk factors for disease.
However, the PFG understands the importance of taking a broad perspective on children's health.
In particular, the ongoing restructuring of many national health systems (health sector reform) has important implications for many aspects of children's health.
The framework thus focuses on specific child health problems and concrete ways to maximize UNF's impact on the larger public health system.
In particular, enhanced local capacity in a specific health area — say, involving adolescents in developing HIV media communications — is likely to be beneficial in other health areas.
Note: Estimated contribution is indicated by plus marks, with a maximum of ++++.
a An initial annual budgetary estimate.
Eradicating polio
The UNF has committed itself to becoming a partner with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in their global initiative to eradicate polio and certify its eradication in 2005. UNF will make a significant grant of $25 million to the initiative and will be active in raising the remaining capital needed, in partnership with WHO and UNICEF, from the public and private sectors.
UNF is supportive, in particular, of the ongoing polio eradication efforts to strengthen the public health infrastructure/capacity.
The PFG recommended that the WHO plan of action for polio eradication should provide the overall framework for UNF involvement.
UNF would solicit a request for funding from WHO and UNICEF on a semi-annual basis, thereby ensuring that monies distributed through UNF would harmonize with the global eradication plan.
To take into account the needs of UNF and UNF partner donors, UNF has established the Polio Eradication Project Strategic Advisory Committee to work closely with WHO and UNICEF.
The Committee will provide expert technical input to the UNF Board to help ensure that resources provided through UNF contribute strategically to priority activities and geographical areas.
Thus additional project proposals are not being entertained in the area of polio eradication.
Within the context of UNF support to the global polio eradication initiative, the PFG:
(a) Strongly endorsed UNF taking on a flagship role to raise funds, in partnership with Rotary International, WHO and UNICEF, from the private sector;
(b) Suggested that the monies raised be disbursed in as flexible a manner as possible;
(c) Suggested that UNF might offer unique assistance (possibly drawing upon Board members) to the eradication efforts in countries in conflict and provide a unique opportunity to demonstrate that public health can triumph over politics;
(d) Recommended that UNF should emphasize strengthening public health infrastructure and surveillance, with an eye to enhancing the capability to deliver other vaccines;
(e) Urged the United Nations system to award prizes and incentives, in particular, to the 30 poorest countries if they reach 80 per cent coverage in routine polio immunizations.
Coverage rates should be verified by an external review process, and rewards should be given to the directors of the Expanded Programme on Immunization as well as other individuals.
Rotary may have an important role in providing funds for prizes;
(f) Strongly supported UNF interest in “telling the story” of the United Nations efforts via the media and supported the development of case studies that could be used in academic settings (e.g., business, sociology or development-related fields).
Measurable and achievable outcome
Additional resources are raised for polio eradication activities.
Example of process indicators
Increased numbers of partnerships among foundations and the United Nations in terms of strengthening the public health infrastructure/ capacity via polio eradication.
UNF-related funding to date
In September 1998, UNF funded a UNICEF project, “Towards the eradication of poliomyelitis in war-afflicted countries”, for $3,090,000.
In May 1999, UNF funded a WHO project, “Acceleration of the polio eradication initiative in global reservoir countries — Nigeria and Democratic People's Republic of Congo”, for $5 million.
Preventing tobacco use
($10 million over multiple years, including the already allocated $4.3 million)
Background and health need
The number of tobacco-related deaths in developing countries is growing exponentially and will soon surpass those in wealthier countries.
Tobacco addiction is a child health problem because 90 per cent of those who smoke in the most developed countries begin doing so before their eighteenth birthday.
In developing countries some begin as early as six years of age.
Tobacco companies continue to market their addictive products to children (particularly in developing countries) by direct and indirect means, such as sporting events.
The global community has acknowledged its concern regarding tobacco advertising in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Convention stipulates that countries should protect children from exposure to deceptive and misleading information on known hazardous agents such as tobacco.
The UNF's early involvement in mitigating tobacco use has helped jump-start the current project “Building alliances and taking action for a generation of tobacco-free children and youth”, in which WHO joins hands with UNICEF, the World Bank, and a range of non-governmental organizations.
This project is illustrative of how UNF can play a catalytic supportive role in enhancing United Nations initiatives and inter-agency collaboration.
Priority areas for UNF focus
The PFG recommended an initial framework for a one-year time period.
During that time, UNF should consult with the Policy and Strategy Advisory Committee for the WHO Tobacco-free Initiative to determine whether their planned activities could constitute a framework, with specific goals and outcomes, that might be used for UNF funding.
The Committee was recently formed and consists of representatives of the United Nations, Governments, and non-governmental organizations (e.g., WHO, UNICEF, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Council of World Medical Association, National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids).
(a) Legal and legislative issues: UNF should support the global dissemination and implementation of knowledge and best practices about the use of effective legislation and positive outcomes of recent litigation in the United States and elsewhere to advance tobacco control.
A critical review is needed to determine where litigation is most likely to yield gains for tobacco control among youth.
In addition, a base must be built for national legislation for tobacco control to adapt information in a realistic manner for developing countries;
(b) Incentives for health: These would include taxes that are applied to tobacco products, with the revenues going to improve health — for example, to fund advertisements against tobacco.
Taxation for health can be a real win/win situation, since the Government generates money and people smoke less.
In some countries, over 10 per cent of government revenue comes from such taxes.
Countries should also be supported in efforts to determine their own unique incentives which might include financial rewards for reductions in adolescent smoking rates.
Increasing taxes on cigarettes has been demonstrated to be an effective way to decrease cigarette consumption, especially among youth;
(c) Media/education: The primary focus should be on how best to involve adolescents in developing counter-advertisements for tobacco products.
Involving adolescents in such projects would have additional value, since those involved would learn better to express themselves.
With the UNF focus, additional value includes:
(a) Strengthening partnerships within the United Nations system (as has already been demonstrated with the early collaboration with WHO, UNICEF and the World Bank), outside the United Nations system, and with non-governmental organizations, Governments and adolescents;
(b) Improving the public health capacity/ infrastructure, through the United Nations ability to promote more socially responsible governmental policy; and strengthening the ability of national public health systems to work better with the government and non-governmental organizations with regard to tobacco.
Measurable and achievable outcomes
Increased country capacity of the public health system to mitigate tobacco use by means of multisectoral strategies
Increased awareness and knowledge of tobacco's adverse effects on health.
Examples of process indicators
Determine which countries have legal systems that are appropriate for legal intervention
Provide Governments with information on the possibility of using taxes on tobacco products as incentives to decrease tobacco use
Increase involvement of youth in tobacco communications programmes, and determining whether such an approach is successful
Determine the best methodologies to develop effective tobacco prevention messages that involve the youth as active partners in the process
Increase in-country capacity to develop effective tobacco prevention communication programmes involving youth as active partners.
UNF-related funding to date
In September 1998, UNF funded a joint WHO/UNICEF project, “Building alliances and taking action for a generation of tobacco-free children and youth”, for $2.8 million; in May 1999, UNF funded a media project, “Tobacco kills — Don't be duped.
A Tobacco-Free World media initiative”, for $1.5 million.
Decreasing child mortality
The World Declaration and Plan of Action of the World Summit for Children sets out measurable objectives for children's health, with reduction of mortality as the first item on the list.
Although tremendous achievements have been made in child survival (e.g., infant mortality has declined by 51 per cent in the past 36 years), about 10 million-15 million children under five years of age still die each year; 97 per cent of those deaths occur in the developing world.
UNF seeks to bring continued attention to this problem and to foster new and innovative approaches to reducing child mortality.
Within the broad context of reducing child mortality, UNF identified four sub-areas for support, described below, and focused upon a selected number of countries.
A. Preventing HIV/AIDS among youth
($5 million annually over three years)
Background and health need
The HIV/AIDS pandemic is a large and growing health tragedy that has the potential to reverse many of the achievements made in child survival.
HIV/AIDS is a complex problem, and only multisectoral approaches are likely to be successful.
The PFG commented that this was an area of increasing inequity of resources between rich and poor areas of the world and stated that if there were ever a need to take risks, it was in this area.
It recommended an initial focus that links aspects of work currently being done to foster behavioural change with efforts to prevent HIV transmission from infected mothers to their uninfected children.
Behavioural change has been shown to prevent HIV/AIDS infection of children and adolescents.
In Uganda, for example, interventions that included behavioural change programmes resulted in significant reductions in the incidence of new infections among 13-24 year-olds, women at antenatal clinics, and persons at voluntary testing centres.
However, additional information needs to be gathered to determine the impact of specific programme components and how best to reach those most in need.
This work needs to be done in the context of educating people about sexuality, ensuring confidentiality during testing of HIV status, and preventing other sexually transmitted infections.
Transmission of HIV from infected mothers to uninfected children is a large and growing problem around the world.
For example, 25 per cent of pregnant women are HIV-infected in some African countries.
HIV-infected mothers may transmit the virus to their babies during birth (estimates of the rate of infection are 20-25 per cent) or while breastfeeding (an additional estimated 15 per cent).
The transmission of the virus can be prevented if the mothers are identified as infected, provided with counselling, given medication during the birth (e.g., AZT), and are provided with adequate alternatives to breastfeeding under safe conditions.
Unfortunately, safe alternatives to breastfeeding are not always within the reach of mothers, due to their cost and inadequate access to clean water.
This issue is a major challenge for the developing world where the majority of children need the protective benefits of breastfeeding.
The issue is also a challenge to the development community which has focused on the “Breast is Best” initiative for several decades.
Although HIV infection of newborns can be prevented, this area has been somewhat neglected because of the complex issues involving testing, counselling, providing safe alternatives to breast milk, and the ethical dilemma of saving the lives of children whose mother (and possibly father) will eventually die of HIV/AIDS.
The PFG also noted that AZT is expensive, and the UNF would most likely not support the purchase of any medications.
Priority areas for UNF focus
The PFG recommended that UNF provide support in the three areas discussed below, which could be linked together:
(a) Improving access to voluntary, confidential HIV testing and counselling.
Such counselling has been shown to be an important element in sparking behavioural change that will minimize the risk of HIV infection.
Testing and counselling needs to be provided in “youth friendly” ways and in creative settings.
Enhanced links with the public and private sectors are likely to increase the availability of test kits.
Programmes that are comprehensive and well thought out are needed.
In addition, the capacity of in-country public health systems should be strengthened to address this issue;
(b) Determining the best infant feeding options for HIV-infected mothers.
This may, however, lead to more infant deaths, due to the unavailability of clean water and infant formula.
Much innovative work could be done with national Governments and appropriate ministries (such as health) to ensure that this important problem is being solved;
(c) Developing HIV prevention communication strategies that actively involve youth as partners.
Involving youth in HIV prevention communication strategies may be a key element to spread effectively messages about how to lower the risk of acquiring HIV.
Youth should be active partners in this process, with a role in shaping the messages and how they would be communicated to the youth community.
With the UNF focus on these areas, additional value includes:
(a) Strengthening partnerships by catalysing the organs of the United Nations system to work more closely together and increasing the role of UNAIDS on these issues; urging close collaboration with the World Bank to increase its involvement and thereby use its resources to leverage the work of other partners; in the public/private sector, facilitating the role of non-governmental organizations and encouraging increased partnerships with industry to provide rapid test kits for HIV status and to strengthen corporate responsibility in providing infant formulas in the context of the HIV pandemic;
(b) Improving the public health capacity/ infrastructure by strengthening capacity to understand what were the successful components of the interventions and thereby to spread best practices; enhancing the United Nations ability to work even more closely with the private sector; supporting local and national capacity to address the HIV epidemic in terms of the identified priority areas;
(c) Links to UNF programme areas on population and women particularly in projects and programmes that target adolescents in terms of behavioural change.
Measurable and achievable outcomes
Increased capacity of national and United Nations public health systems to reduce HIV incidence among youth;
A reduction in HIV incidence among youth.
Examples of process indicators
Increased access to voluntary HIV testing and counselling in antenatal clinics and other settings appropriate for the youth in developing countries
Increased in-country capacity to provide youth with voluntary, confidential HIV testing and counselling, thereby facilitating sustainability
Scientifically grounded counselling of HIV-infected women in the developing world on the most suitable option for infant feeding (i.e., the development of guidelines)
Increased involvement of youth in HIV/AIDS communications programmes, and determining whether that is a successful approach to mitigating the spread of HIV
Increased in-country capacity and determination of the best methodologies to develop effective HIV prevention messages and programmes that involve the youth as active partners in the process
Reduced proportion of boys and girls having first sex before the age of 15.
UNF-related funding to date
In September 1998, UNF supported a $3,090,000 UNICEF project, “Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS: field implementation in seven developing countries”; in May 1999, UNF approved support for a UNAIDS behaviour change project in southern Africa, totalling $1,865,650.
B. Enhancing micronutrient delivery
($2.5 million annually over three years)
Background and health need
) Children whose diets (or whose mother's diets) lack micronutrients may suffer a number of adverse health effects and illnesses, with social and economic costs to society.
The Plan of Action of the World Summit for Children provides examples:
(a) Inadequate consumption of iron can increase the risk of prematurity, low-birth-weight, and infant mortality;
(b) Inadequate consumption of iodine can cause mental retardation and possibly mortality;
(c) Inadequate intake of vitamin A can cause vision problems and mortality.
Priority areas for UNF focus
Delivering micronutrients
The PFG recommended that UNF focus on delivering a group of micronutrients (with particular emphasis on iron) to high-risk populations in a sustainable manner.
A product that contains a group of micronutrients could be delivered to children by specifically fortifying foods that children or pregnant women are most likely to eat.
In addition, creative ways to deliver a micronutrient “product” could be considered but would have to be worked out in a manner that ensures sustainable availability to the poorest of the poor.
The PFG noted that the number of new initiatives in these two areas have been inadequate, given the ability of micronutrients to prevent morbidity and mortality.
New initiatives should give particular attention to bringing in the private sector as active partners. The PFG recommended that UNF focus on developing innovative approaches and “generic” solutions to delivering micronutrients through staple foods (e.g., wheat, maize, flour, rice, oils, noodles) that are consumed by vulnerable subgroups of the population.
This might involve working with the private sector to facilitate fortification of foods (i.e., the addition of micronutrients to staple food products) or to breed micronutrient-dense plants that produce a high crop yield.
The PFG noted that recent evidence suggests that adequate dietary zinc can prevent childhood morbidity and possibly mortality from diarrhoea, respiratory diseases, and malaria.
If these preliminary findings are substantiated, zinc should be included in the group of micronutrients delivered to vulnerable populations.
However, before the public health community can recommend a focus on zinc, a well-designed study must be completed to determine whether or not zinc does truly have these benefits.
Given UNF's limited resources, the study may consider the use of extrapolations to determine zinc's impact on mortality;
WHO defines low birth weight (LBW) as a birth weight below 2,500 grams, or about 5.5 pounds.
Two processes, separately or in combination, govern birth weight: duration of gestation, and intrauterine growth rate.
Shortened gestation and birth weight both have an important effect on foetal and neonatal mortality and the risk of morbidity and disability, although pre-term birth carries a greater risk.
LBW babies that live are more likely than babies of normal birth weight to have congenital anomalies, neuromuscular handicaps, require more health services, do poorly in school, increase family health costs, and disrupt the normal functioning of the family.
Although the rate of LBW in developed countries is constant at around 7 per cent, the rate has been much higher (17 per cent) in less developed countries, with big differences between regions and little change in the past 15-20 years.
Bangladesh, India and Pakistan have the highest rates of LBW (50, 30 and 25 per cent, respectively) and contribute most to the overall rate of 21 per cent for Asia.
In Nigeria and Zaire, more than 15 per cent of babies have low birth weight.
The rate of pre-term births in the developed world has been about 7 per cent; estimates for less developed countries are above 10 per cent.
Unfortunately, inadequate information is available to determine what causes LBW and how to best prevent it in the developing world.
The problem is highlighted in the Plan of Action of the World Summit for Children which calls for work to reduce LBW to less than 10 per cent of births.
Among the global causes of LBW may be limited access to micronutrients, particularly iron and iodine.
Other risk factors may include malnutrition, smoking by the pregnant woman, exposure to passive tobacco smoke during pregnancy, infection during pregnancy, and cultural practices that discourage women in Asia from gaining weight during pregnancy.
The PFG agreed that United Nations agencies should begin to lay the groundwork for working in this area.
The PFG noted that a one-year effort would provide ample opportunity to bring together a technical working group to identify interested partners and outline major issues.
In particular, during the year, that group should:
(a) Describe the problem of LBW — estimating trends, changing patterns, and variability within targeted countries in the general population and with regard to pertinent ethnic groups.
Information should also be presented to describe whether present norms for LBW should be re-evaluated for Asia;
Risk factors may include, but are not limited to, lack of micronutrients, cultural habits, birth spacing, inadequate food intake, and exposure to tobacco.
Existing and new research (including the latest scientific understanding of foetal development) and programme experiences would be examined through work with relevant institutions, including those in areas of the world with a notable LBW problem.
Hypotheses should be generated and prioritized, and studies to address the hypotheses should be recommended;
(c) Use the gathered data to define the scope of the next phase of work — paying particular attention to the fact that LBW is likely linked with many issues and that it is important to prioritize and not lose focus.
In particular, the association between LBW and inadequate access to micronutrients should be addressed;
(d) Present the scope of work to the global public health community, with particular emphasis on the countries that have the greatest problem.
The PFG noted that part of the scope of work would probably include a conference where these issues would be discussed and prioritized.
(The PFG also recognized that, in general, the UNF prefers not to fund conferences.
With the UNF focus on these areas, additional value includes:
(a) Strengthening partnerships with the private sector (e.g., salt producers, the agricultural sector); within the United Nations between its “health” institutions and its “food/agricultural” institutions; and in terms of the work on low birth weight, with the United Nations and outside institutions, such as universities, and within the United Nations system;
(b) Raising additional resources for the United Nations, especially with the engagement of civil societies, such as Kiwanis;
(c) Improving the public health capacity/ infrastructure, by encouraging the public health community to adopt a more cohesive intersectoral approach to delivery of micronutrients, specifically by considering micronutrients as a “group” rather than focusing on one at a time; by determining the role of zinc in decreasing child mortality and knowing whether or not to recommend its administration to children, and by improving the capacity of the United Nations public health system better to address the issue of low birth weight and, in particular, its relationship to micronutrients;
(d) Links to UNF programme areas on population and women and to other components of the children's health programme, for example, micronutrient deficiency among pregnant women (adolescent girls).
Measurable and achievable outcomes
Strengthened United Nations and national public health systems in terms of capacity (via training) and partnerships
Decreased childhood morbidity and mortality
Examples of process indicators
Fortification of food items frequently consumed by children with a group of micronutrients
Consumption by children of the fortified food product
Supplementation with a group of micronutrients targeted to pregnant women and children
Consumption of the supplements by pregnant women and children
Positive media messages that highlight the successful partnership between the United Nations and the private sector/salt producers
A multicentre study on zinc's impact on child mortality and morbidity
In the developing world, a better description of the problem of low birth weight, a better understanding of potential risk factors, including its association with micronutrients, and development of consensus on the next steps, if needed
Explicitly defined and expanded public/ private sector partnerships
Increased capacity of persons who work in national public health systems adequately to address the problem of micronutrient deficiencies
Integration of micronutrient issues into existing public health activities
UNF-related funding to date
In May 1998, UNF supported a $860,000 UNICEF project, “Saving mothers' lives in West Timor”, which provided pregnant women with vitamin and mineral supplements on a weekly basis; in January 1999, UNF supported a $1 million project, “Elimination of iodine deficiency as a public health problem: reducing mental retardation of children in Africa's `Goiter Belt'”, in partnership with Kiwanis, to ensure that iodized salt is made available in as sustainable a manner as possible.
C. Supporting sustainable vaccine delivery
($3 million annually over three years)
Background and health need
Although vaccines are one of the most cost- effective ways to reduce child mortality, many children in the poor areas of the world do not have access to childhood vaccines.
Developing new methods for sustainable vaccine delivery would not only benefit the poorest of the poor, but would be a prime issue around which to leverage additional resources.
In particular, the successful polio eradication efforts are a valuable global platform of human resources and partnerships that should be used to deliver other vaccines and preventive health services.
Priority areas for UNF focus
(a) Encouraging creative ways to deliver vaccines.
The Sustainable Outreach Services (SOS) initiative of WHO/UNICEF provides an example of such an approach.
SOS works with communities that live beyond the reach of usual health services to determine which preventive health interventions are most needed.
Interventions are then delivered during a few days of coordinated community activity.
Thoughtful approaches are also required in order to increase vaccine delivery in urban areas, such as ensuring that health facilities are open during the evenings or weekends.
In addition, vaccine delivery within countries in conflict is a unique challenge;
(b) Promoting innovative incentives for vaccination.
Promoting innovative incentives may also increase vaccine coverage.
For example, awards could be given to district-level managers as part of the district-level health system.
In addition, Governments with low vaccine coverage rates and a well-formulated plan to increase coverage could be provided with creative incentives to implement their plan;
(c) Strengthening coordination of ongoing efforts.
As experience from polio eradication has clearly demonstrated, coordination of efforts is critical.
The importance of coordination was also highlighted in 1984 when many agencies were working independently to raise vaccine coverage rates that were in the range of 10 per cent globally.
A major conference (hosted by the Rockefeller Foundation) brought together international agencies and facilitated the coordination of their efforts through the Task Force for Child Survival.
Within six years, global immunization coverage rates dramatically rose to about 80 per cent.
On a global level, establishing an alliance of the public sector with industry and other private partners could have a large impact on increasing vaccine coverage.
On a country level, building onto the existing mechanisms of UNDAF or the Inter-agency Coordinating Committee (ICC) provides a way for national Governments to work with donor agencies to develop coordinated national plans and budgets — for vaccines as well as other health needs.
In addition, developing a global fund for vaccines would be an important contribution for child health.
This fund might help overcome the stagnation of the Expanded Programme on Immunizations — in terms of a limitation to only six different vaccines and a leveling off or decrease in vaccine coverage rates.
(a) Strengthening partnerships within the United Nations system (UNDP could play an important role in developing financing mechanisms that provide rewards for increasing vaccine coverage within countries; emphasis should also be placed upon close collaboration with the World Bank), outside the United Nations system, and particularly with the private sector and foundations.
(Foundations supported by Mr. and Mrs. William Gates are likely to provide a large amount of support for developing vaccines.
The Rockefeller Foundation also has an interest in promoting access to vaccines. );
(b) Improving the public health capacity/ infrastructure, to increase the United Nations capacity, to establish a forum in which the United Nations, the private sector, and foundations (Rockefeller, Gates, UNF, and possibly others) can work productively together, and establish creative means to increase vaccine coverage, such as through incentives.
Measurable and achievable outcomes
Sustainable vaccine delivery systems functioning in targeted areas
Increased vaccine coverage of 80 per cent or more of targeted populations with designated vaccines
Examples of process indicators
Increased periodic multi-year contacts and access to vaccines among underserved populations
Increased community participation to determine the best methods of delivering preventive health strategies
Increased country commitment to improving immunization coverage through sustainable financial (national budget) means
UNF-related funding to date
In January 1999, UNF supported a $2,250,000 WHO pilot project of the sustainable outreach services (SOS) strategy for immunization and basic health services, which seeks new and creative ways to provide minimum preventive health services (such as immunizations or malaria prevention) to persons in Ghana, Mali, the Niger and Uganda who live beyond the usual reach of such services.
D. Strengthening community knowledge about the needs of sick children: building onto the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses Initiative ($3 million annually over three years)
Many of these deaths in the developing world could be prevented if ill children were taken to a health-care provider and received good quality, comprehensive health care.
A relatively new WHO/UNICEF initiative — the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) — has a broad focus that encompasses interventions at home and in the health system with the goal of preventing child mortality by integrating delivery of preventive and general health services.
The PFG stated that IMCI had one of the largest potentials to decrease child mortality. IMCI is currently being implemented in 60 countries.
UNF should support a specific emphasis on the community component, with interventions targeted at families, since the community component of IMCI has not yet been implemented.
For example, a recent study in Africa found that both male and female caretakers were concerned that they did not recognize that a child was ill and thus could not judge whether to take the child to a health facility.
In addition, the caretakers did not know how to use medications that were provided and were also uncertain as to what foods to give ill children.
IMCI should seek to move towards the integrated management of childhood health, by strengthening the community's (i.e., primary caretakers, community health workers and traditional birth attendants) capacity to improve the health of children.
Doing so will also increase the United Nations ties with the community and enable the United Nations system better to reach the poorest of the poor at the community level.
(a) Strengthening partnerships between the community, non-governmental organizations and the United Nations;
(b) Improving the public health capacity/ infrastructure, by increasing the United Nations capacity to deliver effective programmes and, by supporting and strengthening the United Nations involvement with communities.
Measurable and achievable outcomes
Improvements in the public health system due to more people seeking appropriate health care and development and integration of a community-level component into IMCI strategies and programmes
Reduction of childhood mortality in targeted countries
Examples of process indicators
In five countries, improved community knowledge of how to recognize illness among children, when to seek health care for an ill child, how to administer medications to ill children, how to feed/provide liquids to ill children, and the importance of adhering to care recommendations.
V. Monitoring and evaluation of the children's health programme framework
Given the framework's three-year time span, monitoring and evaluation activities are of critical importance in terms of assessing progress and reviewing results and outcomes.
Suggestions of elements that might be included in monitoring and evaluation activities follow.
Each outcome should have an associated measure (performance indicator) and an explanation of the measuring process to facilitate monitoring activities.
Prior to the occurrence of any monitoring and evaluation activities, it will be necessary to collect reliable baseline data from sources such as the United Nations, the World Bank, USAID, bilateral agencies, and universities.
Those data are necessary for defining the parameters of each problem/disease area in the project countries and for tracking trends over time.
The data should include: data on the magnitude of the disease problem and data on the gaps in a country's ability to deliver services, provide public health interventions and conduct surveillance (condition of the public health capacity/infrastructure).
The expected outcomes, which will define the success of the framework's approach, can be grouped into two major areas and stated in measurable terms:
(a) Health outcomes for the target populations;
(b) Process outcomes to improve and strengthen the public health capacity/infrastructure.
Activities that are phased allow for effective monitoring of periodic outputs and help to motivate performance by setting specific stepped targets (benchmarks and milestones) and realistic objectives within defined time-frames.
This approach permits projects to build in assessments at each phase, to measure progress towards the next target, to remain flexible, and to employ corrective actions, when indicated.
Performance/progress measures and indicators include, but are not limited to:
(a) United Nations agencies working together at the country level (partnerships/coordination/resource mobilization);
(b) United Nations agencies working with non-governmental organizations and other appropriate organizations at the country level (partnerships/ intersectoral coordination);
(e) Design and implementation of innovative public health (and other) interventions, including use of incentives/rewards, tax remedies, legal controls, advertising influences, bioengineered crops;
(f) Identification and spread of best practices where they are known or when they become known over the life of the project;
(g) Behaviour change of providers (first performance indicator); behaviour change of target populations (second performance indicator); behaviour change of target population over defined, extended time period (final performance indicator);
(h) Targeting of specific populations;
(i) Coordination of interventions and follow-up with corrective actions under the community-based component of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) programme.
Evaluation
The sum contribution of each component of the multiple interventions will provide proof that the programme works.
There are two major programme framework outcomes that are expected:
(a) Target population health outcomes: decreased mortality; behaviour change (with a stated and reasonable goal to expect) and acceptance of public health interventions; increased knowledge translated into changed actions; and improved health status;
(b) Process outcomes: an expanded and strengthened public health capacity/infrastructure (coordination of delivery system components, increase in vaccine distribution, and legal regulation); an increase in United Nations capacity (from increase in partnerships/coordination/resources); an increase in sustainability; and improved quality of effective services.

Agenda item 124 Joint Inspection Unit
Comments by the Administrative Committee on Coordination on the report of the Joint Inspection Unit entitled “Private sector involvement and cooperation with the United Nations system”
Note by the Secretary-General
The Secretary-General has the honour to transmit for the consideration of the members of the General Assembly the comments of the Administrative Committee on Coordination on the report of the Joint Inspection Unit entitled “Private sector involvement and cooperation with the United Nations system” (JIU/REP/99/6).
I. Introduction
The report of the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) on private sector involvement and cooperation with the United Nations system was originally proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
It was included in the work programme of JIU for 1999 because of the emerging new relationship of the United Nations system with the private sector.
General comments
The JIU report addresses an issue of growing relevance and importance to the United Nations system at large and presents a timely contribution.
Indeed, at its first regular session in April 1999, ACC emphasized that the system needed to build multidimensional partnerships with the private sector to assist developing countries in capitalizing on the opportunities arising from globalization while minimizing the risks.
The Secretary-General has moreover stated that the United Nations needs business as an advocate for international cooperation, a promoter of investment, trade and open markets, to promote development by investing and transferring technology to developing countries and as a partner of dialogue on economic social and related issues.
To establish and maintain meaningful dialogue with private business and to involve private firms in the work of the United Nations system are challenging tasks.
To be successfully pursued, they require sustained attention as well as sensitivity to different cultures and possible conflicting interests.
Therefore, in entering into partnership activities, due regard must be given to allocating sufficient skilled resources to this task.
It is vital that the system pursue complementary approaches.
A common understanding of the objectives of and opportunities opened by the initiative of the Secretary-General through the Global Compact with Business is absolutely essential.
Members of ACC emphasize that, in pursuing a compact or understanding with the private sector, the development dimension of the partnership should be stressed and other partners should be actively engaged, that is, different levels of government, municipal authorities and parliamentarians, as well as trade unions and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
The development dimension should draw from, inter alia, the programmes of action agreed by the international community at the series of global conferences held in the 1990s.
The JIU inspectors describe the increasing frequency and breadth of collaboration between the United Nations system and the private sector, defined as members of the business community (from small to medium-sized enterprises to multinational corporations, including the informal sector) and their representatives (who may act through not-for-profit associations such as chambers of commerce or philanthropic foundations).
It states that the objective of partnerships between the United Nations and the private sector should not be limited to mobilization of resources, but to encouraging the private sector to integrate the values of the United Nations, channelling investments towards least developed countries and building a strong new constituency for the Organization as a whole.
There is at present considerable diversity within the United Nations system, both in respect of the regulations and practices that govern cooperation with private sector entities, and in the approaches that guide the way the funds, programmes and agencies interact with the private sector in order to maximize the benefits while protecting themselves from the inherent risks.
The present report makes a series of recommendations to ensure greater transparency and accountability and to avoid undue influence of special interest groups while promoting further links between the United Nations and private sector entities.
Members of ACC welcome the report, and its helpful analysis of opportunities as well as risks.
They also underline the usefulness of the reference material annexed to the report including the comparative table of guidelines issued by various United Nations system organizations, which provides a useful listing of good practices.
Specific comments on recommendations
Recommendation 1
The participating organizations should set realistic objectives and expectations for their partnership with the private sector.
These objectives and expectations should be clearly enunciated and publicized, possibly through the adoption of a strategic document on this issue to be prepared by respective secretariats and endorsed by governing bodies (see chapter II, paras.
Members of ACC endorse this recommendation, noting that collaboration with the private sector should be in line with the fundamental principles and strategic and operational objectives and the particular methods of work and constituents of their respective organizations.
Especially important in this context is a balanced approach in collaboration with private sector entities from developed and developing countries.
Objectives and expectations for partnerships should be wholly consistent with the United Nations system Charter goals.
Recommendation 2
The secretariats of the participating organizations should: (a) carry out outreach programmes targeting the private sector; (b) each designate a focal point, or at least identify easily accessible units, to serve the needs for information and assistance of the business community (see chapter II, paras. 26, 27 and 28).
Members of the ACC endorse the general thrust of the recommendation.
They note that appropriate action and relevant initiatives, including outreach programmes, are being actively pursued throughout the system in response to concrete requirements and specific programme objectives, which vary from organization to organization.
At the same time, they recognize that a number of sector-specific initiatives require cooperation among different organizations, and support, in such cases, joint outreach activities.
Members of ACC agree with the recommendation to establish focal points for private sector-related issues as an additional way to enhance greater coherence and collaboration within the system and to facilitate exchange of experience.
Common approaches continue to be fostered, including through system-wide training efforts supported by the United Nations Staff College in its collaborative programme with the Prince of Wales Business Leaders Forum.
Recommendation 3
Participating organizations should: (a) ensure the presence of United Nations representatives at relevant business events and organize joint encounters; (b) encourage as wide as possible a participation from the private sector in their relevant activities, with special attention to enterprises (and their associations) based in developing countries and/or countries in transition (see chapter II, para.
This recommendation is in line with existing practices and is generally supported by members of ACC, on the understanding that participation of the business sector in activities of the United Nations system should take place in accordance with existing rules.
Members of ACC welcome the emphasis on the participation of enterprises (and their associations) from developing countries or countries in transition.
Recommendation 4
The working group established by the Secretary-General's Senior Management Group should proceed with drafting guidelines on relations with the private sector and ensure that these guidelines are promptly disseminated throughout the Secretariat, as well as the funds and programmes.
These guidelines should draw on the important work that has been undertaken by some funds and programmes (see chapter III, para.
Members of ACC note that in line with this recommendation, a working group established by the Secretary-General's Senior Management Group is proceeding with drafting guidelines on relations with the private sector, which are expected to be of a generic nature and will aim to promote coherence in approaches in dealing with the private sector.
They could serve as broad reference points since the diversity of each organization's mandate and activities may require the determination of more specific internal guidance.
At the same time, members of ACC strongly support efforts by its subsidiary machinery, for example the Consultative Committee on Programme and Operational Questions (CCPOQ), in aiming at facilitating common approaches at the field level through the resident coordinator system.
They agree with the need for the elaboration by CCPOQ of system-wide guidance on the collaboration at the field level of country teams with the business sector in the broad context of operational activities of the system.
Recommendation 5
United Nations agencies that have not yet done so should also adopt a set of guidelines, taking into consideration the work carried out by the working group mentioned in recommendation 4.
These guidelines should include a statement of principles as well as a description of procedures to be followed for dealings with the private sector (see chapter III, paras.
While endorsing the above recommendation, ACC members consider that internal guidelines by member organizations should address conditions for, inter alia, the use of an organizational name and logo, as well as acceptance of voluntary contributions and gifts from non-governmental sources, including business entities.
ACC members agree that internal guidelines should draw on the common framework and common approaches as emerging from the efforts of the working group as well as of CCPOQ referred to in the comments on recommendation 4.
The guidelines should ensure that the activities of the intended donor are compatible with mandates of United Nations organizations and Charter principles and that the donor should not be seen to have direct or evident indirect commercial interests in the activity to be financed.
Recommendation 6
The United Nations should consider ways of ensuring the implementation of Staff Rule 101.6, including the feasibility of extending rules for financial disclosures (see chapter III, paras. 73, 74 and 81).
Other participating organizations should also examine whether their respective staff rules and regulations are sufficient to guarantee that staff members do not hold a financial interest in commercial enterprises with which a partnership is envisaged.
Members of ACC endorse the recommendation and underline the need to ensure that system-wide approaches are supported through efforts by the relevant inter-agency mechanisms.
In this context, they note that during 1999 and 2000, CCAQ collaborated with the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) and the staff bodies on the update of the 1954 report of the International Civil Service Advisory Board entitled “Standards of Conduct in the International Civil Service”.
At its fifty-first session in Vienna in April 2000, ICSC decided to inform the General Assembly that it had adopted the text of the Standards, pending any comments from the organizations legal advisers, and further decided to submit them to the General Assembly and the organizations of the common system.
Recommendation 7
Concerned offices in all participating organizations should speed up internal processes and establish specific time-frames, within the framework of existing rules and regulations, to ensure that bureaucratic procedures and lengthy time of response do not discourage initiatives from the private sector (see chapter III, paras. 76-78 and 80).
The general thrust of this recommendation is endorsed by members of ACC.
They wish to draw attention, in this regard, to the expected impact of various reform measures taken or ongoing organizational change initiatives particularly as they relate to increased delegation of authority, decentralization and local resource mobilization activities.
They further recognize the need for building capacities to effectively handle partnership approaches, and note in this regard the important role of focal points and the potential support which could be provided through training on a system-wide basis by the United Nations Staff College.
Recommendation 8
Suitable mechanisms for the sharing of information and best practices with regard to relations with the private sector should be established, using the ACC structure as appropriate, to ensure consistency of policy and harmonization of relevant procedures throughout the United Nations system (see chapter III, paras.
They recognize that the central web site (www.un.org/partners/ business) established with the support and inputs of a large number of United Nations system organizations and entities, provides the required common platform for systematically sharing information and experiences.
Members of ACC support efforts to fully exploit the potential of the common web site and agree to ensure the required additional inputs.
They endorse, in particular, steps to enhance the web site by adding information reflecting learning experience, which should be carried out with the involvement of the concerned inter-agency mechanisms within the ACC machinery and the United Nations Staff College.
They note that the common web site will serve in addition as a gateway providing linkages to the relevant sections of the individual sites of member organizations.
Members of ACC further support the need for greater consistency of policy and harmonization of relevant procedures throughout the system.
In their view, this should be achieved through the full involvement of the relevant inter-agency mechanisms, with particular emphasis on the efforts to support greater coherence and common approaches at the field level.
Fifty-fourth session
Agenda item 118
Review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations
Regulations governing the status, basic rights and duties of the Secretary-General
Report of the Secretary-General
I. Introduction
The General Assembly, by paragraph 9 of its resolution 52/252 of 8 September 1998, requested the Secretary-General to expedite the submission to the Assembly, by the fifty-fourth session, of appropriate regulations and rules governing the status, basic rights and duties of the Secretary-General, officials other than Secretariat officials and experts on mission.
The present report is submitted in response to that request.
Constitutional background
Pursuant to Article 97 of the Charter of the United Nations, the Secretary-General is appointed by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council, and is the chief administrative officer of the Organization.
In accordance with Article 98, the Secretary-General shall act in that capacity in all meetings of the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council and the Trusteeship Council, and shall perform such other functions as are entrusted to him by those organs.
In accordance with Article 97, the Secretariat comprises the Secretary-General and such staff as the Organization may require.
Although the Secretary-General is not a staff member, he or she is a member of the Secretariat and an official of the Organization.
In accordance with Article 100, the Secretary-General, in the performance of his or her duties, shall not seek or receive instructions from any Government or from any other authority external to the Organization.
The Secretary-General shall refrain from any action that might reflect on his or her position as an international official responsible only to the Organization.
Under Article 105, paragraph 3, the General Assembly is empowered to make recommendations with a view to determining, inter alia, the privileges and immunities of officials of the Organization or to propose conventions to Member States for that purpose.
The Assembly did so by adopting the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations on 13 February 1946 (resolution 22 (I)).
Article V of the Convention provides for privileges and immunities of officials and provides that the Secretary-General shall be accorded the privileges, immunities, exemptions and facilities accorded to diplomatic envoys, in accordance with international law.
The General Assembly, by its resolution 11 (I) of 24 January 1946, approved the observation of the Preparatory Commission that, given that the Secretary-General is a confidant of many Governments, no Member State should offer him or her, at any rate immediately on retirement, any governmental position in which his or her confidential information might be a source of embarrassment to other Member States, and on his or her part a Secretary-General should refrain from accepting any such position.
The General Assembly, by its resolution 590 (VI) of 2 February 1952, adopted the Staff Regulations of the United Nations.
Staff regulation 1.10 provided that the Secretary-General should make the following oath or declaration orally at a public meeting of the Assembly:
“I solemnly swear (undertake, affirm, promise) to exercise in all loyalty, discretion and conscience the functions entrusted to me as an international civil servant of the United Nations, to discharge these functions and regulate my conduct with the interests of the United Nations only in view, and not to seek or accept instructions in regard to the performance of my duties from any Government or other authority external to the Organization”.
Staff regulation 1.10 was abolished with the adoption of a revised article I of the Regulations (see below).
Proposal by the Secretary-General concerning regulations governing the status, basic rights and duties of the Secretary-General
In his report on a proposed United Nations Code of Conduct (A/52/488), the Secretary-General submitted for consideration by the General Assembly a draft of the revised text of article I of the Staff Regulations and chapter I of the 100 series of the Staff Rules concerning the status, basic rights and duties of United Nations staff members.
In the report, the Secretary-General indicated that the Administration would propose a separate set of regulations and rules governing the status, basic rights and duties applicable to the Secretary-General, officials other than Secretariat officials and experts on mission (ibid., annex II, section A.2, para.
The General Assembly, in its resolution 52/252, adopted the revised text of article I of the Staff Regulations and took note of the revised text of chapter I of the 100 series of the Staff Rules applicable to United Nations staff members, as set out in the report of the Secretary-General (A/52/488, annex I), subject to certain modifications.
In reviewing the Charter for the purpose of developing draft regulations and rules governing the status, basic rights and duties of the Secretary-General, officials other than Secretariat officials and experts on mission, it has become apparent that, with the exception of the oath or declaration of office to be made by the Secretary-General, the provisions of the Charter relating to the Secretary-General appropriately address the status, basic rights and duties of the Secretary-General.
In view of those provisions, and with the understanding that the Secretary-General would continue to orally make the declaration now contained in staff regulation 1.1 (b) at a public meeting of the Assembly, the Secretary-General believes that there is no need for additional regulations and rules in regard to the Secretary-General.
The declaration contained in staff regulation 1.1 (b) provides as follows:
“I solemnly declare and promise to exercise in all loyalty, discretion and conscience the functions entrusted to me as an international civil servant of the United Nations, to discharge these functions and regulate my conduct with the interests of the United Nations only in view, and not to seek or accept instructions in regard to the performance of my duties from any Government or other source external to the Organization.”

Agenda item 117
Financial reports and audited financial statements, and reports of the Board of Auditors
Implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors concerning United Nations peacekeeping operations for the period ending 30 June 1999
Report of the Secretary-General
I. Introduction
The General Assembly, in paragraph 7 of its resolution 48/216 B of 23 December 1993, requested the Secretary-General to report to it, at the same time as the recommendations of the Board of Auditors are submitted to the Assembly, on measures taken or to be taken to implement those recommendations.
Accordingly, the present report responds to the recommendations of the Board made in its report on the accounts of the United Nations peacekeeping operations for the 12-month period ending 30 June 1999.1 This response is based on the assumption that all such recommendations would be approved by the General Assembly at its current session.
In preparing the present report, account was also taken of the provisions of the following General Assembly resolutions:
(a) Resolution 50/204 A of 23 December 1995 (in particular para. 4, regarding implementation of the Board's recommendations);
(b) Resolution 51/225, section A, of 3 April 1997 (in particular para. 10, regarding the timetable for the implementation of recommendations of the Board of Auditors);
(c) Resolution 52/212 B of 31 March 1998 (in particular paras. 2-5) and the note by the Secretary-General transmitting the proposals of the Board of Auditors for improving the implementation of its recommendations approved by the Assembly (A/52/753, annex).
Implementation of recommendations contained in paragraph 12 of the report of the Board of Auditors
In paragraph 12 (a) of its report, the Board of Auditors recommended that inter-office vouchers pending clearance in the financial statements should be disclosed in gross terms.
This recommendation has been implemented.
In paragraph 12 (b), the Board recommended that the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts ensure that all expenditure relating to a financial period is captured in the accounts for more accurate financial reporting.
The Board further recommended that the Office and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations improve their coordination to ensure accurate financial reporting.
The Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts ensures that all known expenditures relating to the financial period are captured in the financial statement based on information supplied by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.
In some cases, the Department is not able to record expenditures owing to the unavailability of appropriate funding resources.
In such situations, the Office has requested the Department to provide financial data so that this information can be disclosed in the financial statements as a contingent liability pending approval by the General Assembly of additional appropriations in order to satisfy the pending liabilities.
If a troop-contributing country's claim is submitted to the Field Administration and Logistics Division of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations after the end of a financial period to which it applies, or for that matter at the liquidation phase of a mission, it can only be reflected as a contingent liability.
Based on the above, in our view, there was no inaccurate reporting of government claims in the financial statements, as we have provided information on this issue in the notes to the financial statement.
The coordination between the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts has been strengthened.
Claims received from troop contributors are reviewed and verified by the Department and forwarded to the Office.
The Department ensures that certified claims submitted to the Office have sufficient obligated funds to facilitate further processing.
In addition, the Department prepares monthly reports on all claims that have been certified or await certification and are forwarded to the Office for information and review.
In paragraph 12 (c), the Board recommended that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations explore additional areas both at Headquarters and in the field missions to facilitate procurement planning to minimize costs.
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations continually reviews its procurement requirements in an ongoing attempt to identify additional areas where cost-saving mechanisms, such as volume purchase agreements or systems contracts, can be beneficial to the Organization.
As a result, initiatives in the areas of information technology, engineering, general defence stores and the like have led to cost savings and administrative processing efficiencies.
It should be noted that not all procurement requirements lend themselves to systems contracts.
For many service contracts, generic specifications cannot be developed since they have to be tailored to the particular circumstances of the mission.
The Department will continue to explore new areas for cost savings and, to this end, welcomes the Procurement Division's continued efforts to expand and improve its supplier database.
The Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations is responsible for the implementation of this recommendation.
In paragraph 12 (d), the Board recommended that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations remind field missions to comply with the provisions of the Procurement Manual, which require the missions to submit to their procurement sections procurement plans based on realistic estimates.
This recommendation has been implemented.
The Field Administration and Logistics Division recently sent facsimiles to all missions reminding them of the importance of submitting procurement plans based on realistic estimates by their procurement sections and will follow up accordingly.
In paragraph 12 (e), the Board recommended that the Procurement Division review the practice of procuring items under free-on-board contracts to ensure consistency with the provisions of the Financial Rules and the Procurement Manual.
Discussions are under way to define circumstances in which inspection would be appropriate.
The cost implications of inspections also need to be considered.
There are many shipping points at which technical inspectors are not available and need to be flown in.
In such cases, the cost of inspection may outweigh the risk of faulty delivery.
Problems such as the ones encountered with the tyres2 rarely occur.
In the case cited, the suppliers acknowledged fault and the tyres are being replaced.
The Assistant Secretary-General for Central Support Services is responsible for the implementation of this recommendation.
In paragraph 12 (f), the Board recommended that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Procurement Division establish procedures for obtaining prompt advice on status of goods received at the field missions to facilitate the expediting function and the completion of the procurement process.
In order to expedite the completion of the procurement process initiated at Headquarters, the Department is, wherever possible, transferring the responsibility for making payments to the end-user to the field mission.
The practice with regard to Headquarters procurement has up to now been for missions to send receiving and inspection reports to the Field Administration and Logistics Division, which in turn processes the receiving and inspection function in the Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) (until such time that IMIS is implemented in the field) and forwards copies to the Accounts Division and the Procurement Division for information.
Invoices from vendors and suppliers are received by the Accounts Division for review and payment.
The Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations is responsible for the implementation of this recommendation.
In paragraph 12 (g), the Board recommended that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations take action to locate the relevant records relating to the disposition of the assets of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) and ensure that for the future such records are made readily available for audit review.
The recommendation has been implemented.
Additional records pertaining to the liquidation of UNOMIL have been obtained from United Nations storage facilities in New Jersey and are currently located in the Liquidation Team's office in the Finance Management and Support Service of the Field Administration and Logistics Division.
Lessons learned from the liquidation of past missions are now taken into account; liquidation guidelines are forwarded to chief administrative officers prior to liquidation in order to facilitate and speed up the process in the mission.
Proper handling of documents in the field facilitates their transport and storage and ultimately their retrieval at Headquarters.
Progress made during the liquidation of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force is a case in point.
In paragraph 12 (h), the Board recommended that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and missions standardize the main types of assets used, such as vehicles, generators and communication and data-processing equipment, in order to improve maintenance and usage.
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations concurs with this recommendation and is moving in that direction, conditions in each particular mission permitting.
The Field Administration and Logistics Division has made substantial progress in its efforts to standardize major and common items of equipment, such as vehicles, information technology and communication equipment, achieving, in addition to cost savings, improved maintenance capacity.
However, as stated on previous occasions, operational and political exigencies may at times override the intention to standardize equipment in the field.
The Field Administration and Logistics Division developed the field assets control system to provide proper control of the Organization's assets and to ensure uniformity in the management of assets in peacekeeping missions.
The asset module of the system will be fully implemented in the planned peacekeeping mission by mid-2000.
Further developments include a prototype module for expendable inventory items, which is designed to enhance decision-making with regard to issues related to procurement, delivery, redistribution, replenishment, storage, write-off and disposal of mission assets.
This module is scheduled for implementation during 2000.
These measures are expected to contribute the standardization of the main types of assets used, thereby maximizing the use of the Organization's resources.
The Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations is responsible for the implementation of this recommendation.
In paragraph 12 (i), the Board recommended that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations request liquidating missions to properly evaluate the cost-effectiveness of any proposed transfer of assets.
The cost-effectiveness of any proposed redeployment of assets by liquidating missions to other missions or to the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, is closely monitored by the Field Administration and Logistics Division in accordance with the policy on the transfer of assets (see A/51/905, para.23), which was endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 52/1 A of 15 October 1997.
The Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations is responsible for implementation of this recommendation.
In paragraph 12 (j), the Board recommended that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations review the arrangements for screening and testing civilian police monitors with a view to improving the effectiveness of the selection process.
In order to improve its effectiveness in this regard, the Department's Civilian Police Unit is arranging train-the-trainers workshops to assist police-contributing countries to enhance their training capacity.
Workshops have been arranged for Eastern Europe (in Sweden), Asia (in Malaysia) and Africa (in Ghana).
In 2000, the plans are for one workshop for Central and Eastern Europe to be held in Hungary and one for North and South America (location to be decided).
Furthermore, a visit from the Selection Assistance Team (SAT) can be requested by contributing countries.
SATs comprise personnel from the Civilian Police Unit and field missions, and their task is to test candidates in their home countries before deployment.
Candidates who are cleared by SAT will not be tested again in the field mission.
As the number of civilian police in peacekeeping missions can be expected to increase to between 7,000 and 9,000 during the present calendar year, SAT activities have to be planned on a yearly basis in order to avoid repeated tests in some countries.
The Civilian Police Unit is also reviewing the training curriculum for pre-mission training for civilian police.
A curriculum for a three-week United Nations police officers course has been prepared.
The Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations is responsible for the implementation of this recommendation.
In paragraph 12 (k), the Board recommended that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations ensure that in no case should personnel be assigned to a mission prior to medical clearance being obtained.
The observation that civilian police personnel have been deployed without medical clearance is correct.
Because of the recent large increase in the number of civilian police observers in field missions, currently established policies and procedures have proven insufficient.
The Civilian Police Unit is working with the Medical Services Division to find a functional solution in order to avoid such problems in the future.
The Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations is responsible for implementation of this recommendation.
Implementation of recommendations contained in the body of the report of the Board of Auditors
In the body of its report, the Board recommended, in paragraph 33, that government and non-government obligations be provided with distinct code numbers in IMIS for more effective monitoring.
The Administration is reviewing the possibility of establishing separate identifying codes in IMIS to classify government-related obligations so as to facilitate the retrieval of information from IMIS.
The Assistant Secretaries-General for Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts and for Common Support Services are responsible for the implementation of this recommendation.
In paragraphs 35 to 39 of its report, the Board observes that there was a negative fund balance for the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia of $2.6 million as at 30 June 1999 and expresses its concern that supplementary information provided by the Administration to the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions was inaccurate and had resulted in insufficient assessments to cover the budget requirements.
Although the Board has not submitted a specific recommendation on the matter, it is the intention of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts, as it had intimated to the Board during its review of the subject, to submit a report to the General Assembly in which it would, inter alia, request approval of additional resources to cover the negative fund balance as well as any other liabilities owed to troop-contributing countries being identified by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations that have not previously been taken into account.
In paragraph 43, the Board recommended that the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts instruct the missions: (a) to regularly review accounts receivable and ensure prompt settlement of all outstanding amounts; (b) to enforce the recovery policy by deducting telephone and liberty mileage charges from mission subsistence allowance or salary, as appropriate; and (c) to initiate prompt write-off action where there is little chance of recovery.
All missions have been informed and correct procedures have been put in place to be followed when establishing and collecting accounts receivable.
However, as recommended by the Board, the Assistant Secretary-General for Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts is taking action to remind missions to take appropriate steps with regard to the issues raised by the Board.
Action is also being taken to write off long-outstanding amounts deemed irrecoverable at this time.
In paragraph 51, the Board recommended that the Administration emphasize to the missions the enforcement of established procedures for accounts receivable to be recovered from separating staff members, civilian police and military observers to avoid financial losses to the Organization.
The recommendation has been implemented.
Reminders have recently been sent to all missions on the importance of enforcing established recovery procedures with respect to separating mission personnel.
In paragraph 71, the Board recommended that the Administration continue to adhere to the requirement for submission to the contract committees for consideration, even in cases of procurement under exigency.
Examples are given of the type of situation that could endanger the mandate of the mission or endanger lives.
An exception to calling for bids or proposals does not preclude presenting the case to the appropriate committee or committees on contracts should the cost of the goods or services be above the delegated level of authority.
The use of exigency should be viewed in the context of the particular circumstances existing in the mission at the time of the procurement action and whether or not the procurement course chosen was reasonable for the success of the mission under those circumstances.
The Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations is responsible for the implementation of this recommendation.
In paragraph 87, the Board recommended that the Administration emphasize to the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA) the need for full compliance with established procedures regarding the use of miscellaneous obligating documents.
This recommendation has been implemented.
The administration of MINURCA implemented a system to regularly review encumbered balances to comply with United Nations procedures and to ensure that the Organization's resources are used in a timely and effective manner.
This includes instructions to the Mission's finance section to ensure that reports on the status of outstanding obligations and unencumbered balances are issued regularly to enable certifying officers to review their respective accounts on time.
Furthermore, the Field Administration and Logistics Division has recently sent a fax to all missions reminding them of the need to follow established procedures governing the use of miscellaneous obligation documents.
In paragraph 100, the Board recommended that, even when a mission was in the process of liquidating, it should still ensure that there is proper separation of duties in the initiation of expenditure.
All requests for work on building systems should be made through the Engineering or Building Management Section, with a detailed and properly authorized work order, which should decide on the need for and priority of the work.
Procedures to be followed for implementing building construction, installation of camp systems and repair/maintenance projects are outlined in the mission logistics directives and in the Engineering Support Services Manual of Procedures, which the Division distributes to all missions. These are to be adhered to by the missions at all times, including during liquidation.
The manual has been sent to all field missions as well as relevant offices at Headquarters.
The Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations is responsible for the implementation of this recommendation.
In paragraph 102, the Board recommended that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, in conjunction with the Procurement Division, ensure that all field missions comply with the established procedures relating to reporting on the performance of vendors and contractors.
This recommendation has been implemented.
The Department recently sent a fax to all missions reminding them of the need to follow reporting procedures on vendor/contractor performance in respect of contracts entered into by the Procurement Division at Headquarters.
In paragraph 109, the Board recommended that the Administration reintroduce the training programme for chief administrative officers and to extend it to cover other management personnel.
The training of chief administrative officers and senior management personnel continues to be an issue of high priority.
The Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations expressed encouragement at the establishment of a three-month training programme for potential chief administrative officers and urged the Secretariat to include the role of the chief administrative officer in the preparation of mission budgets into the training programme.
The chief administrative officers and chief financial or budget officers of field missions are now invited to New York to discuss and review their respective mission budget proposals with the relevant offices at Headquarters and also to participate in deliberations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.
The Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations is responsible for the implementation of this recommendation.
In paragraph 116, the Board recommended that the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts effect the necessary entries in the accounts to fully record the proceeds from the sale of assets of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia.
The Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts has ascertained that the income from the sale of two defective generators has been appropriately adjusted and recorded in the accounts.
It is unfortunate that this information was not readily available to the auditors during their audit review.
The details of this transaction are in the field accounts located in the mission liquidation unit of the Field Administration and Logistics Division.
In paragraph 121, the Board recommended that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations pursue and obtain acknowledgements for all assets transferred by the United Nations Military Observer Group in Guatemala to the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, and retained in the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA).
The Department has requested MINUGUA to provide acknowledgements as requested by the Board.
The Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations is responsible for implementation of this recommendation.
In paragraph 134, the Board recommended that the Department ensure that the staff of peacekeeping missions involved in property control have adequate skills in inventory procedures, equipment recognition and computer use.
Property control training is given to staff in the field missions as part of the implementation of the field assets control system.
The system was designed in part to reflect United Nations procedures, policies and guidelines on property control in data entry and workflow, such as property categories, physical check-ups, serial number control, bar code or decal number controls and so on.
The field assets control system project team in the Field Administration and Logistics Division is putting together draft guidelines on what property control procedures must be standardized throughout field missions; currently these instructions are limited to what currently affects data entry and workflow in the system, but it is expected to be all-inclusive upon finalization.
The Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations is responsible for the implementation of this recommendation.
In paragraph 139, the Board recommended that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and missions plan any future transfers of equipment with the aim of maximizing the standardization of equipment held by receiving missions.
In principle, the Department concurs with the recommendation.
However, as stated on previous occasions, operational and political exigencies may at times override the intention to standardize equipment in the field.
The Field Administration and Logistics Division developed the field assets control system to provide proper control of the Organization's assets and to ensure uniformity in asset management in peacekeeping missions.
The system includes an expendable inventory item prototype module, which is meant to enhance decision-making with regard to issues related to procurement, delivery, redistribution, replenishment, storage, write-off and disposal of mission assets.
The Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations is responsible for the implementation of this recommendation.
In paragraph 146, the Board recommended that the Field Administration and Logistics Division make every effort to reduce the backlog of property survey cases and, in particular, consider streamlining and strengthening the operations of the team responsible for processing the cases.
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations shares the concerns expressed by the Board with regard to the backlog of property survey cases, which it has been attempting to resolve for some time.
As approximately 60 per cent of the outstanding property survey cases pending with both the Field Administration and Logistics Division and the Headquarters Property Survey Board fall under $500, the Division is convinced that the way to address the backlog is to delegate authority to the field for a final decision on cases involving assessment of mission personnel below the amount of $500.
In paragraph 150, the Board recommended that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations ensure that: (a) a clear and comprehensive security strategy is introduced early in missions; (b) all staff, including military personnel, are provided with guidance on ensuring the security of assets; and (c) where appropriate, vehicle immobilization devices are used on United Nations-owned vehicles.
In addition to staffing missions with sufficient numbers of trained and experienced security personnel (civilian or military), the maximum physical protection possible is being installed in missions, including fencing, lighting, alarms, surveillance cameras, safes and so on.
The theft of vehicles is a matter of great concern in all field missions since they comprise a large part of the monetary value of peacekeeping assets.
Increasingly, electronic ignition and tracking “CarLog” systems are being installed in mission vehicles.
On the other hand, the implementation of the field assets control system improves the recording and monitoring of inventory.
Mission personnel are regularly reminded, through the issuance of administrative instructions and circulars, to take care of the property assigned to them and are made aware of the consequences if they are found to have been responsible for their loss or damage.
The Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations is responsible for the implementation of this recommendation.
In paragraph 152, the Board recommended that the Department ensure that responsibility for welfare items, where they continue to be provided by the United Nations, is vested in the civilian administration.
This recommendation has been implemented.
The Field Administration and Logistics Division will ensure that welfare items provided by the United Nations will be part of the civil administration's responsibility.
In paragraph 158, the Board recommended that the Department ensure that missions enforce staff departure procedures, including checks to ensure that all equipment issued has been returned, and such procedures should also be applied to military or civilian police officers with responsibility for United Nations-owned equipment.
The Field Administration and Logistics Division has recently reminded field missions to comply with these procedures.
The Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations is responsible for the implementation of this recommendation.
In paragraph 167, the Board recommended that the Department instruct missions to ensure that they take full inventory of and prepare condition reports on properties that they intend to occupy and that they support these reports with detailed photographic evidence where possible.
This recommendation has been implemented.
The Field Administration and Logistics Division has recently sent a written reminder to all missions on the subject.
In paragraph 174, the Board recommended that the Department instruct peacekeeping missions to ensure that trust funds are used only for the purposes cited.
This recommendation is being implemented.
The Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations is responsible for the implementation of this recommendation.
In paragraph 179, the Board recommended that the Administration ensure that full and accurate information on fraud and presumptive fraud be provided to the Board of Auditors in accordance with the Financial Rules.
All missions have been reminded of their duty to report all cases of fraud or presumptive fraud to the Office of Internal Oversight Services and the Controller immediately.
The Controller is responsible for providing this information to the Board of Auditors.

United Nations reform: measures and proposals: the Millennium Assembly of the United Nations
Regional hearings in preparation for the Millennium Assembly of the United Nations: hearing held for the region of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific at Tokyo on 9 and 10 September 1999
Note by the Secretary-General
In preparation for the Millennium Assembly of the United Nations and the Millennium Summit of the United Nations, and at the request of the Secretary-General, regional hearings have been convened by the executive secretaries of the five regional commissions for a representative segment of civil society, with the participation of members of the commissions.
The purpose of the hearings was to produce proposals aimed at strengthening the role of the Organization and ensuring its continued relevance in the twenty-first century.
The report on the hearing for the region of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, held at Tokyo on 9 and 10 September 1999, is transmitted herewith.
Hearing held for the region of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific at Tokyo on 9 and 10 September 1999
I. Introduction
The hearing for the region of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), held in preparation for the Millennium Assembly of the United Nations, was convened at the United Nations University at Tokyo, on 9 and 10 September 1999.
Three moderators, Ronald Huisken, Department of Defence (Australia) Cielito Habito, The Earth Council (the Philippines), and Razali Ismail, President of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly (Malaysia), chaired the sessions devoted to, respectively, the following themes: peace and security; economic and social development; and human rights and good governance.
Thirteen panellists introduced the above-mentioned themes.
Other participants, representing Member States of the Asia and Pacific region and a cross-section of civil society organizations, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academic and research institutions, the media and the private sector, numbered 143.
A summary of the outcome of the hearing is set out below.
General discussion on the United Nations
The hearing noted at the outset that the global challenges of peace, security, development, human rights and good governance confronting mankind were closely interlinked.
In effectively addressing these challenges at the beginning of the twenty-first century, it was therefore essential, first of all, to conceptualize and design, at the national, regional and international levels, integrated and coherent policies.
The meeting underlined that the United Nations was the only global organization with competencies to address the totality of global concerns and challenges.
Moreover, its comparative advantage as the sole organization with quasi-universal membership and wide mandates, an extensive network in countries and territories and linkages and partnerships with various sections of the civil society compelled the United Nations to further its leadership role and activities for the betterment of the human condition, particularly in the developing world.
In view of the changing circumstances and emerging challenges, the hearing considered that a revitalized United Nations was urgently required.
It was noted that the rapid process of globalization of the international economy had, inter alia, exposed the limitations of national Governments in solving increasingly complex problems.
This recent development had triggered an increased demand for international public goods, including a peaceful and stable environment, stable and transparent markets and economic processes, equitable development, environment preservation and the promotion of human rights and good governance.
To meet these diverse challenges and aspirations, the revitalization of the United Nations presupposed a genuine reiteration by Member States of their commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and its objectives, which must translate into the effective individual and collective exercise of the responsibilities of all Members in pursuance of the Charter.
In this connection, it was emphasized that responsible membership entailed the design of rational mandates and the timely endowment of resources for the effective execution of those mandates.
The meeting also recognized that, in view of the presence of other multilateral organizations with specialized mandates, such as the World Bank Group, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, as well as the limitation of resources, the United Nations should develop its leadership role in the resolution of global challenges.
It should provide the vision, set the agenda, prescribe standards, monitor and evaluate progress and foster global partnership, encompassing international, regional, subregional and national as well as business and civil society organizations.
The meeting also took note of the revival of proposals for the direct participation of people and recalled that the Preamble to the Charter starts with the sentence “We, the peoples of the United Nations, determined to ...”.
These proposals included the establishment of a world parliament directly elected by the people, an advisory body to the General Assembly comprised of eminent personalities and the establishment of the World NGO Forum.
Peace and security
The meeting noted that threats to peace, as well as political instability and social unrest were often rooted in conditions of underdevelopment, poverty, inequality and poor governance.
To offset these threats, it was recognized that the promotion of equitable social and economic development and good governance was not for its own sake alone, but because it was the best guarantor of peace and security.
In this respect, it was deemed important to promote a partnership framework between the United Nations, regional and subregional organizations, Governments and civil society at large, with a view to ensuring the maintenance of peace and security.
During the last decade, the world has witnessed major changes that have significant bearing on the effective maintenance of peace and security.
The following developments were considered to have had a profound impact on the future role of the United Nations in the area of peace and security:
(a) The end of the so-called cold war and, with it, the abated risk of strategic nuclear war;
(b) The drastic reduction of inter-State wars and the high incidence of intra-State disputes and conflicts, often along ethnic rather than ideological lines;
(c) An international political landscape characterized by localized zones of active or latent turmoil;
(d) The reconsideration of the basis of the concept of national security over international security and, as a corollary, of the concept of national sovereignty;
(e) The tendency of localized conflicts to reach subregional dimensions and the risks they pose to international peace and security;
(f) The drastic rise of international terrorism and international crime, including trafficking in women and in narcotic drugs, all of which impinge on human security;
(g) The relative shift of economic and financial power;
(h) The volatility of international capital markets.
While noting that the above-listed developments brought about new challenges related to the maintenance of peace and security, the hearing underlined that many threats associated with the so-called cold war, such as nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, remain a constant concern.
The meeting reiterated that the United Nations was the only global organization dealing with peace and security.
Its active role was, therefore, indispensable in managing global peace and security, including the timely and effective actions against State and non-State actors pursuing actions in violation of the Charter, international law and international humanitarian law.
The meeting called first and foremost for a systemic reform of the Security Council, the principal organ entrusted with the maintenance of peace and security, which should include enlarged membership of the Council with a view to reflecting and representing the current international and regional balance of economic and military power.
A call was also made for a transparent decision-making modus operandi of the Council.
Regarding the representativeness of the Security Council, the meeting underlined that the Asia and Pacific region had been particularly under-represented in that organ.
The hearing held the view that some permanent members of the Council had made abusive use of their veto power.
It recommended that the use of veto prerogatives be qualified and that, moreover, the General Assembly fully assume its present legislative responsibility with respect to the maintenance of peace and security and that it be granted oversight capacity for the Security Council.
The hearing was of the opinion that, in exercising its mandate, the Security Council should be more proactive in preventing conflict.
In other words, its efforts towards peacemaking rather than simply peacekeeping should be enhanced and pre-emptive diplomacy should be accorded a higher priority, in line with chapter VI of the Charter on the pacific settlement of disputes.
In addition, attention should be paid to the development of an effective peace and security information system, including a robust early-warning system capable of detecting threats to peace or other forms of insecurity and more frequent use of private diplomacy and regional security arrangements should be encouraged to prevent conflicts.
The meeting also recognized that the Asia and Pacific region still lacks a viable region-wide security arrangement.
The meeting noted the increase in intra-State conflicts, often characterized by gross violations of the principles of international humanitarian law, including the targeting of civilian populations and children.
Regarding intervention, including military intervention, to resolve such conflicts on humanitarian grounds, the consensus was that such intervention should be governed by clear and transparent policies and procedures within the framework of the United Nations.
The meeting recommended that in order for the United Nations to be efficient and effective, it should be endowed with adequate resources, including the availability of rapid deployment military forces at the disposal of the Security Council.
A number of unfinished items, namely disarmament and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, remain on the agenda of the United Nations.
The meeting felt that a world platform for multilateral disarmament should take precedence over bilateral agreements and that the role of the Security Council in setting the agenda and priorities for effective disarmament should be strengthened.
The United Nations should also pay more attention and devote more resources towards the elimination of international terrorism and crime, which has been rising rapidly, particularly in recent times.
As this activity is often linked to drug trafficking and money laundering, measures aimed at controlling those activities are urgently needed.
Economic and social development
The meeting noted that globalization provides new opportunities for growth and development worldwide through the much freer flow of goods, services, technology, capital and information and, more generally, through the creation of conditions conducive to the more efficient functioning of competitive markets.
In view of the frequent failure of markets to yield equitable development, the hearing underlined that, especially in recent years, globalization has been accompanied by widening income disparities among, as well as within, countries and regions.
The major challenge was to seek ways to reap the benefits of globalization while mitigating its ill effects, especially those affecting the most vulnerable and marginalized nations and segments of society.
In this context, the role of the United Nations was crucial.
The meeting underscored that poverty eradication remained an unattained goal of international development cooperation.
Despite its rapid growth, the Asia and Pacific region was still the home to the majority of the world's poor.
Moreover, the rapidly ageing structure of the population has become an impending challenge for the twenty-first century.
A holistic approach to development was essential in addressing the challenges posed by, inter alia, poverty, rapid urbanization, and ageing populations.
In implementing its mandates pertaining to these problems, the United Nations should provide a global vision, set standards and guidelines and catalyse actions by other involved institutions and stakeholders.
In view of its comprehensive mandates, representativeness, quasi-universal membership, structure and linkages with various segments of the society throughout the world, the United Nations was considered to be uniquely poised to address new challenges.
The hearing pointed out that in such an increasingly complex world, no single national Government or agency was capable of comprehensive and integrated development.
The United Nations, therefore, was called upon to strengthen its development partnership framework through closer coordination and collaboration with various multilateral organizations, including the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization, and to foster closer cooperation among its own bodies, including the specialized agencies.
The meeting further stressed that sustainable development required a partnership among all stakeholders in development, namely national Governments, the private sector, NGOs and other civil society organizations.
The partnership needed to materialize at all levels of interaction, local, national, regional and global, and at each stage of the development process encompassing planning and policy-making, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
The United Nations should contribute to strengthening such partnerships.
It was noted that the process of globalization generated a rise in the demand for international public goods.
As the role of the United Nations was critical in facilitating or providing them, a strengthened Economic and Social Council would be indispensable for that purpose.
In this regard, there was a need to change the composition and scheduled sessions of the Council so as to enable in-depth substantive deliberations of items on its agenda.
The view was expressed that it was incumbent upon the international community to reaffirm the leadership role of the Council in economic and social matters, as well as its function of coordinating the specialized agencies.
The view was also expressed that permanent committees under the Economic and Social Council, such as a “Committee on Economic Development” and a “Committee on the Environment”, could be established.
Also, panels of independent experts should be constituted to advise the Council in dealing with such issues as short-term capital flow, rising global monopolies, poverty eradication, micro-credit support, counter-productive tax competition among countries and youth-related and disability-related matters.
Development requires sound institutions.
Indeed, there has been a recent heightened recognition of the critical role of institutions in promoting successful development.
The hearing considered that access to knowledge, technology and information was critical to local communities and to developing countries for the promotion of better living conditions for all peoples.
It was recognized, however, that inequality of access to, or lack of, technology and information may be an even greater factor than income disparities between industrialized and developing countries in furthering the growing gap between them.
The United Nations was called upon to assume critical and much needed leadership in addressing these imbalances.
The hearing advocated a sounder and stronger financial base for the United Nations if it is to live up to the challenges of the twenty-first century and to the expectations of the peoples it represents.
A sustainable financial resource base needed to be set up, which would include the payment of membership dues based on capability.
V. Human rights and good governance
The meeting noted that human rights and good governance were critical subjects of our time and that the region was strongly committed to universal values of human rights.
As human rights were indivisible, the promotion of civil and political rights should be carried out in tandem with the promotion of the right to development, including equitable access to health, education and other social services.
Indeed, human rights could not flourish in the absence of development, democratic institutions and good governance.
Poverty, it was emphasized, was a gross violation of human rights.
Countries should be encouraged to set time-bound targets for the elimination of poverty and for the upholding of other economic, social and cultural rights of people.
Effective enforcement of human rights required public awareness of such rights, effective monitoring institutions and continued advocacy by various segments of the society, including NGOs.
The meeting recalled that transparency, accountability and adherence to the rule of law and participatory political and social processes were fundamental elements of successful governance.
In many instances, however, these principles were being heralded and complied with on a pro forma basis.
Special measures to address the challenges faced by vulnerable groups such as women, children, the elderly and the disabled were necessary given the lack of adherence to national and international legal instruments and guidelines promoting equal access and opportunities for these vulnerable groups.
It was further noted that armed conflict and other forms of violence impacted more severely on children, women and older people and entailed serious psychosocial traumas and physical disabilities on these segments of civilian populations.
It was emphasized that women were caring for the young and the elderly to a disproportionate degree and were being inadequately compensated for their labour.
This reality, which was further exacerbating gender-biased inequalities and hampering social development, required proper attention.
The hearing rejected the Western-centred interpretation of the discourse on Asian values as a negation or rejection of individual rights.
It recalled that, whereas Western thinking on human rights generally placed a distinct emphasis on individual political and civil rights, Asian thinking on the subject was predicated on more communitarian values and principles.
In this regard, the United Nations was called upon to calibrate its efforts and human rights activities to take the values of different civilizations and cultures into account and to dovetail the promotion of individual and communitarian human rights principles.
The hearing recognized the immense contribution made by, or under the aegis of, the United Nations to the promotion of human rights and good governance by the setting of norms and the development of international human rights instruments; however, the Organization's ability to monitor and ensure compliance with legal obligations needed to be enhanced.
In this respect, the United Nations should also be encouraged to promote and support the formation of human rights organizations at the national and regional level and to provide technical assistance to Governments as well as to the media and civil society organizations to strengthen their respective monitoring capacities.
Moreover, the United Nations should be endowed with adequate resources and vested with appropriate authority to take adequate measures in the event of massive gross violations of human rights.
During the last decade, in particular, the Asia and Pacific region has experienced a period of relative peace and, until recently, rapid and equitable economic growth.
The region still faces, however, enormous challenges regarding peace and human development in the twenty-first century as trouble spots in the region, both between and within countries, posing potential serious threats to peace and security, remain.
Widespread poverty and inequality, challenging peace, violations of human dignity and social stability and environmental degradation, hampering sustainable development, are serious problems with consequential negative long-term effects.
To respond to these problems, a serious, integrated and holistic approach to development, necessitating a broad vision and firm action by Governments, peoples and supra-national bodies, needs to be collectively and collaboratively pursued.
No single Government would have the capacity and wherewithal to handle these problems alone.
The support for the United Nations and its objectives, as embodied in its Charter, remains overwhelmingly strong in the Asia and Pacific region.
Indeed, the hearing underscored that the United Nations was a source of great hope for humankind.
The Organization, therefore, required support and resources and, against the background of its many shortcomings in exercising its mandates, the hearing urged a serious effort towards a systemic reform of the Organization.
The hearing felt that the participation of the Asia and Pacific region in the United Nations processes was not commensurate to the relative political, economic and social importance of the region and appealed to Governments and civil society in the region to enhance participation and contribution to all workings of the United Nations.
The hearing also supported increased participation of civil society organizations in the workings of the United Nations.
It considered that proposals towards a permanent civil society assembly or a world parliamentary assembly, organically linked to the General Assembly, with a view to reinforcing the ownership of the United Nations by the people of the world, merited serious consideration.
Fifty-fourth session
Agenda items 118 and 127
Follow-up review of the programme and administrative practices of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat)
Note by the Secretary-General
Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 48/218 B of 29 July 1994, the Secretary-General has the honour to transmit, for the attention of the General Assembly, the attached report, conveyed to him by the Under-Secretary-General, Overseer of the Office of Internal Oversight Services, on the follow-up to the 1997 review of the programme and administrative practices of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat).
The Secretary-General takes note of its findings and concurs with its recommendations.
Report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services on the follow-up to the 1997 review of the programme and administrative practices of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat)
Contents
I. Introduction
On 23 April 1997, the Secretary-General transmitted to the General Assembly the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) concerning the review of the programme and administrative practices of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat) (A/51/884).
In summary, the findings of the report suggested that there were significant weaknesses in the management of the Centre:
• A strategic vision was lacking.
• Activities were not supportive of each other and resources were dispersed thinly.
• An effective system for monitoring programme implementation and assessing results was not in place.
The report concluded that the weakness of leadership, the lopsided organizational structure, duplication of functional responsibilities and blurred accountability affected negatively the financial position of the Centre and the confidence of its donors.
The Commission on Human Settlements, in paragraph 4 of its resolution 16/8 of 7 May 1997, requested the Secretary-General to ensure prompt implementation of the recommendations of OIOS.
The General Assembly, in its decision 51/468 G of 13 June 1997, took note of the report of OIOS and Commission resolution 16/8, and of the assurances of the Executive Director that the Centre had begun the implementation of recommendations contained in the report of OIOS, and encouraged the Centre to implement fully the recommendations as approved by the Commission.
The good intentions notwithstanding, the implementation during the following year was sporadic and inconsistent and the decisive turnaround in the performance of the Centre was nowhere in sight.
The purpose of the current OIOS inspection, which took place in October 1999, was to assess progress in the implementation of the previous recommendations in the context of the ongoing revitalization of the Centre, with particular attention to how it had affected the efficiency and financial situation of the Centre.
The OIOS findings and recommendations are grouped below under main subject areas.
They are prefaced by a brief overview of developments that have taken place since the 1996 inspection.
The annex shows the current organizational structure of the Centre.
The inspection team met with the management of the Centre and its staff and had the benefit of receiving the views of the Member States directly during the course of a special meeting of the Committee of Permanent Representatives in Nairobi.
OIOS greatly appreciates the cooperation extended to its team by the management and the staff of the Centre.
The comments of management were sought on the draft report and were taken into account in the preparation of this final report.
Summaries of such comments are provided in italics under the respective recommendations (see paras.
OIOS was encouraged by the commitment of the Centre, expressed in its comments on the draft report, to address fully all issues raised in the present report and to implement all recommendations.
Recent developments
The Acting Executive Director acknowledged that despite a number of assessments, reviews and studies, by mid-1998 the Centre was still experiencing serious problems and faced an extremely uncertain future.
He therefore appointed, in September 1998, a Revitalization Team, which proposed a strategic vision for Habitat (see HS/C/17/2/Add.2, annex) and a new organizational structure, and provided recommendations on management and administrative matters.
The Committee of Permanent Representatives and the staff were consulted in the preparation of the report, which was adopted by the Acting Executive Director as the blueprint for the revitalization of the Centre.
The programmatic and interdisciplinary aspects of the Centre's work also benefited from the recommendations of the United Nations Task Force on Environment and Human Settlements (see A/53/463).
The reaction of stakeholders to the revitalization programme was largely positive, as reflected in the discussion at the seventeenth session of the Commission on Human Settlements and in the decisions adopted at that session.1 In its resolutions 17/1 and 17/6 of 14 May 1999, for example, the Commission recognized that the overall thrust of the new strategic vision for the Centre and its emphasis on two global campaigns were strategic points of entry for an effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda, acknowledged the ongoing revitalization and its linkages with the wider United Nations reform and welcomed the management's commitment to develop Habitat into the centre of excellence on the themes of adequate shelter for all and sustainable urban development.
By its resolution 17/7 of 14 May 1999 on the revitalization of the Habitat Centre, the Commission mandated the Executive Director to implement the new strategic vision comprehensively and encouraged him to implement fully, as a matter of urgency, all administrative and financial management reforms, as part of the ongoing revitalization process.
By its resolution 17/20 of 14 May 1999 on the work programme and budget of the Centre for the biennium 2000-2001, the Commission approved the draft work programme along with the strategy contained therein to combine normative and operative functions, while underlining the need for the programme adequately to reflect the strategic vision for a revitalized Centre, and also endorsed the reorganization of the Centre.
Planning and organization
In its 1997 review, OIOS found that the Centre lacked a central thrust in programmatic activity, and that there was very little effective linkage between the research and programme functions; there was insufficient synergy between subprogrammes and efforts at capacity-building had faltered.
OIOS recommended that the work programme should be more focused, better integrated and reflect the strong linkages between research and technical cooperation; it should also integrate the functions of the regional units within the overall programmatic structure.
OIOS further recommended that any reorganization of the Centre should be aligned to the programme structure with its organizational elements mutually supportive of each other, and that the fragmentation of scarce resources over small units should be avoided (A/51/884, paras. 51 and 52).
Since then, the Centre has developed a strategic vision, realigned its work programme to that vision and restructured its organization.
The strategic vision aims at recognizing the Centre as the United Nations city agency, which should adopt the style and profile of a global advocacy agency and use two strategic campaigns, each derived from one of the two main themes of the Habitat Agenda: one for secure tenure and the other on urban governance.
The current inspection noted that the underlying principle of the new vision was to avoid the dispersion of effort, and to strengthen organizational coherence.
The draft work programme for 2000-2001 consists of two subprogrammes compared to eight in the past and is strategically focused with a limited number of well-defined objectives aimed at achieving the goals of the Habitat Agenda.
It also differs from past programmes in stressing interlinkages between normative and operational activities.
The programme emphasizes the strengthening of the strategic and operational partnerships of the Centre along with building up the Centre's comparative advantages, while ensuring that the Centre does not duplicate expertise available elsewhere, especially within the United Nations system.
OIOS finds the new work programme, expressed in the format of objectives, expected results and performance indicators, to be an effective instrument for concentrating the Centre's resources and expertise on the priorities defined by its strategic vision.
The inspection team shared with the management its observations concerning specific flaws and weaknesses it has detected in the formulation of some of the expected results and performance indicators.
Those observations were accepted and will be implemented in the course of designing the work plans for the Centre's divisions for 2000-2001.
Concerning the new organizational structure (see annex), OIOS found that it fulfils the purpose of streamlining executive management and concentrating the Centre's resources on implementation of its two subprogrammes and their respective global campaigns.
The reorganization envisages that the regional offices will become fully integrated into the work of the Centre and act as its regional focal points.
OIOS finds the new structure to be in accord with the letter and spirit of its earlier recommendation.
Two substantive divisions, the Global Division and the Regional and Technical Cooperation Division, carry out the subprogrammes and a third provides support in programming, administrative and financial management, resource mobilization and facilitating cooperation with partners:
• The Global Division has overall responsibility for aligning the normative and policy activities of the Centre around two global campaigns of secure tenure and urban governance.
A key component of the Division is the Urban Secretariat, whose task is to provide support to both divisions in monitoring and assessment, developing indicators and statistics and disseminating best practices.
• The Regional and Technical Cooperation Division is tasked with projecting the Centre's campaigns into regions and providing direct policy and technical support to regional partners and fostering regional cooperation in urban and shelter development.
Its important function is also to feed back knowledge gained into all policy components of the Centre.
• The Programme Support Division is tasked with ensuring, inter alia, that the Centre utilizes effective planning and has sound financial and administrative management and proper servicing of funding partners.
The Division provides overall direction and guidance on the allocation and management of the Centre's resources and is responsible for designing a comprehensive fund-raising policy and managing fund-raising activities.
The inspection found that the Programme Support Division had to spend a considerable amount of time correcting the backlog of problems inherited from predecessors, while being simultaneously fully engaged in the set-up of the new organizational structure.
There is an absence of strategic planning and guidance to tackle these problems comprehensively and in a coordinated manner, as well as time-frames for their eventual elimination.
On the positive side OIOS noted that, through donors' funding, the Centre commissioned consultants to develop an information technology strategy during the period from September to December 1999.
The strategy defines a long-term information technology vision and sets implementation priorities (including a time-frame).
Among the key issues addressed by the strategy are: development of project management tools to support all knowledge-intensive work and the control and monitoring of projects; enhancement of the use of the Internet and the World Wide Web for general communication and dissemination of information, and the relevant organizational structure.
The new organizational structure of the Centre was submitted to Headquarters for approval in February 1999.
OIOS was concerned with the inordinate length of time spent at Headquarters in reviewing and clearing the draft Secretary-General's bulletin promulgating the new structure of the Centre.
Eventually, the three interconnected bulletins relating to the three units in Nairobi were issued on 23 December 1999 (ST/SGB/1999/20, 21 and 22).
Leadership and management
OIOS was strongly impressed by the dedicated, visionary and forceful leadership provided by the Acting Executive Director to an organization previously uncertain of its mission.
It is also essential from a motivational standpoint to assure staff that top management is working daily with them to advance the reform.
OIOS is concerned that the Acting Executive Director spends a large proportion of the official working hours away from Nairobi.
OIOS appreciates his dedication in maintaining a high political visibility and is aware of the extreme intensity of the Acting Executive Director's work schedule while in Nairobi, which covers long hours and includes weekends.
It was noted also that out of eight meetings of the Senior Management Group held in 1999, four were chaired by the Acting Executive Director in person, and that constant communication is maintained between him and his Acting Deputy during his absence.
However, given the heavy competition for the Acting Executive Director's time between the Centre, the United Nations Office at Nairobi (UNON) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), OIOS does not consider this arrangement to be healthy or to meet the Centre's requirements.
V. Performance monitoring, evaluation and project appraisal
In its 1997 report, OIOS recommended that the Centre establish a mechanism for performance monitoring, evaluation and reporting, and that the project appraisal function be separated from the monitoring and evaluation function.
It was further recommended that consideration of lessons learned be added to the project design process and that the rigour of the appraisal process be increased (A/51/884, paras. 56, 57 and 59).
At the time of the current review, the Centre had established a monitoring mechanism and programme performance reporting which are incorporated into the Secretariat-wide Integrated Monitoring and Documentation Information System (IMDIS).
A programme oversight system is operated by the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit, which is staffed by one Coordinator and provides methodological support and guidance to self-evaluation along with a substantive contribution to the establishment of mechanisms, criteria and guidelines for design, monitoring and evaluation of research and operational activities.
The inspection noted the proactive initiatives of the Coordinator of the Unit in producing an inventory of all current and envisaged evaluation activities of the Centre.
Regrettably, the effort to transform this inventory into an interactive database was interrupted by the shortage of funds.
Another commendable initiative was participation in establishing the Nairobi Monitoring and Evaluation Network, which includes the United Nations entities, other international organizations, non-governmental organizations and academic and research institutions.
The Network has provided a forum to share experiences and lessons learned and to discuss emerging issues.
A valuable undertaking of the Network was conducting in September 1999 the inaugural meeting of the African Evaluation Association, which provided a unique opportunity for training and exchange of experience on a wide range of evaluation subjects, including topics of immediate relevance to the Centre's work.
The work of the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit will be challenged by the fusion of normative and operational activities envisaged by the revitalization process.
This will require the development of coherent and compatible performance indicators and evaluation benchmarks applicable to both types of activities.
It may not be feasible to accomplish this complex and resource-intensive task with the current meagre staffing of the Unit.
It is also a task that will be certain to delay even more the development of the interactive evaluation database, an important instrument supporting the institutional memory of the Centre.
OIOS ascertained that the project appraisal function was separated from the monitoring and evaluation function in May 1997.
It was noted that with the establishment of the Programme Review Committee, a project design checklist was developed to facilitate the assessment of activities at the design stage.
The criteria included in the checklist have since been revised based on the experience gained and are being consistently used in the appraisal of project proposals.
Additional mechanisms for strengthening feedback from past and ongoing projects are currently being considered.
Administrative and financial management
In the 1997 report, OIOS recommended a set of measures aimed at strengthening financial control, assigning certifying and approving responsibilities, streamlining relevant organizational arrangements and managing overhead support costs (ibid., paras.
The Centre has taken decisive measures to improve financial control and to ensure that regional offices have documented terms of delegated authority.
This aspect of the recommendation is considered closed.
However, while financial control has improved, the Centre still appears to be experiencing problems with financial management. In particular:
• Lack of adequate, accurate and timely financial information is seen as an obstacle towards further restoring donor confidence.
• Computerized financial data exchange between Nairobi and the regional offices and field projects is virtually non-existent.
These problems are partly historical and partly attributable to the absence of procedures to verify, monitor and review the accuracy and completeness of financial data on a regular basis.
The problem is further exacerbated by delays in the processing of inter-office vouchers.
Although these problems largely relate to the financial services of UNON, it is up to the Centre to ensure that reliable standards are set and met.
UNON and the Centre are working together to address the immediate problem of inaccurate financial data.
For instance, Habitat has provided project finance to UNON to strengthen temporarily the middle management of the Financial Resources Management Service of UNON and to make improvements in the recording and reporting of financial data.
UNON and Habitat have also worked together to produce annual and quarterly “consolidated” accounts of all the income and expenditure, assets and liabilities, managed by the Centre.
However, these initiatives require more effective coordination and a determination of mechanisms and resources needed to provide the financial information in an accurate and timely manner.
Financial situation
The Commission has warmly welcomed the revitalization effort as an important step in regaining donor confidence, a step that appears to have prompted several significant donors to positive financial responses.
In reviewing the Centre's proposed budget for 2000-2001, the Advisory Committee noted the positive developments in the revitalization of Habitat, while expressing its concern that it had yet to be reflected in an appreciable and sustained increase in contributed income and that the United Nations Habitat and Human Settlements Foundation remained exposed to risk of financial volatility and unpredictability.
It noted that the increase in 1998-1999 was limited to the special-purpose contributions, whereas general-purpose income continued to decline, thus limiting the flexibility to respond quickly to programme opportunities (see HS/C/17/9/Add.1, para.
Indeed, the expected income of the Foundation's general-purpose fund, which may be viewed as a measure of donor confidence, shrank in 1999 by 17 per cent compared to 1998, down to US$ 3,065,385.
Owing to late payments, actual income, as of 1 October 1999, was only around 45 per cent of the expected income and, as a result, expenditures exceeded income for the most part of 1999.
A further blow to the Centre's financial stability will be the discontinuation, in December 1999, of the long-standing support of a major donor.
This may result in the loss of Professional staff with specialized experience, which will impact on the programmatic capacity of the Habitat Centre.
Given that the Habitat Centre will be launching two global campaigns in 2000, energetic efforts both to demonstrate tangible improvements in financial and administrative management and to broaden the donor base are essential.
OIOS is mindful of the fact that the dynamics of contributions is not necessarily linked directly to the Centre's performance; various extraneous political and budgetary considerations of donor countries may influence contributions.
A key element is the inevitable time lag needed to translate positive political appraisal by the donors into budgetary appropriations.
During this key time of the revitalization process, it is important to demonstrate consistent, demonstrable and convincing results.
Any slack or reversal in the revitalization effort could have a disproportionate negative effect on donors' confidence.
The Centre has done little to contact other United Nations agencies to see if there are lessons to be learned from the experiences of others in fund-raising and overall relations with donors.
In the 1997 report, OIOS recommended that the strengthening of regional activities should be part of a well-articulated policy strategy in accordance with Commission on Human Settlements resolution 15/7 of 1 May 1995 (A/51/884, para.
54). In that connection, the Revitalization Team recommended that one of the best ways to integrate regional offices would be to provide for regular budget funding for part of the staff costs in each of them.2 Concerning regionalization, the Commission, in its resolution 17/4 of 14 May 1999, requested the Executive Director, inter alia, to elaborate a comprehensive strategy for the representation of Habitat in the regions, its decentralized functions and its offices other than in Nairobi.
The Executive Director stated, in that regard, that owing to the current financial situation of the Centre, regional offices would need to be financed by the regions themselves, i.e., by combining overheads generated from projects executed in the respective regions with earmarked contributions from host countries (see HS/C/17/2, para.
The regionalization policy, presented to the Commission on Human Settlements at its seventeenth session by the Acting Executive Director, envisaged that as part of the ongoing reorganization, the regional offices would become fully integrated into the work of the Centre and act as regional focal points for the global campaigns, as well as sources of high-quality inputs to the work of headquarters.
The offices would thus have the ability to operate as an integral part of the Centre for the benefit of the regional member States, cities and partners.
Provisions were made in the new structure to broaden the activities of the regional offices so that they reflect the integration between normative and operational capacities at the regional level.
The work programme of the regional offices is designed to incorporate the Centre's work programme and the global campaigns, adapting the Centre's policies and strategies to the regions.
OIOS considers the regionalization activity to be one of the more successful areas of the revitalization process.
The three regional offices covering Africa and the Arab States, Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America are established and have successfully developed operational, awareness-raising and capacity-building activities in relevant regions.
OIOS noted economies realized by closing information offices in Amman and Mexico City and incorporating their activities into the respective regional offices.
However, OIOS noted that although two of the three regional offices - Africa and the Asia/Pacific - are financially stable, the third one is locked in a perpetual struggle for funds, relying almost entirely on earned overhead income.
Such preoccupation with daily survival and the inherent unpredictability do not bode well for the long-term sustainability and coherent development of its normative capacity, unless some backstopping is put in place by the Centre.
The Centre intends to enhance the linkage between the operational activities and the normative function of the two global campaigns of Habitat by strengthening the analytical capacity of the regional offices.
While it will undoubtedly enhance cross-pollination of the operational and normative activities of Habitat, it is difficult to contemplate how it can be achieved within the prevailing resource constraints.
In this connection, OIOS finds merit in the aforementioned recommendation of the Revitalization Team to allocate regular budget resources towards this purpose.
OIOS also noted with interest the initiative under discussion to establish another regional office covering Central Asia and Eastern Europe and is of the view that such a course of action would strengthen international outreach and the operational capacity of Habitat.
Institutional memory
In 1997, OIOS emphasized that there was an urgent need for effective institutional memory serving the needs of operational units and stakeholders (A/51/884, paras.
While convincing results have been achieved in building institutional memory in specific substantive subject areas, such repositories of knowledge remain compartmentalized, with cross-cutting access either difficult or non-existent.
Concerning the Centre's own organizational institutional memory, it remains amorphous and disjointed and requires a coherent strategy, expertise and resources to achieve the desired effectiveness.
Among successful examples of consistent and continuous development of specialized institutional memory are the series of quarterly and biennial summary reports on operational activities containing comprehensive information on financial, geographical and topical aspects of each project; the programme on the dissemination of best practices, which operates its own web site and distributes CD-ROMs; the compendium of indicators on human settlements development; and the inventory of evaluations and project appraisals, and others.
Centres of excellence concerning institutional memory do exist in Habitat, localized around specific areas and serving mostly narrowly defined user groups.
To make this specialist institutional memory comprehensive and user-friendly, cross-linkages between the databases and universal access through multiple points of entry are required.
Only with those facilities in place would the interests of stakeholders be served effectively.
OIOS was encouraged by the fact that the Centre's management is cognizant of the need to develop a holistic approach to substantive institutional memory and prepared to act on it.
The universal electronic access through an on-line interactive system is included in the terms of reference of the team developing a strategic information technology plan for Habitat.
However, given its financial situation, the cost of such a project may be prohibitive.
As for the development of Habitat's own organizational institutional memory, it remains in the embryonic stage.
The abolition years ago of its Documentation Centre, the need to vacate, because of financial constraints, a sizeable share of its former premises and the resultant chaotic disposal of records, the absence of a uniform taxonomy of records and an official archival policy: this negative legacy lingers on and has so far prevented any decisive steps towards resolving the problem.
To move the situation from this lethargic point, a set of competent, practical steps is required.
Unfortunately, the Centre lacks specialized expertise on records and archives management, and resorting to ad hoc solutions could only further aggravate the situation.
X. Management advisory mechanisms and internal communications
The 1999 inspection team was satisfied that the recommendations have been fully implemented; moreover, the Centre took advantage of the situation to help foster a new, more agile, multidisciplinary and results-oriented culture in the Centre.
OIOS considers this to be one of the successes of revitalization.
The Centre has in place the elements of a strong structure for vertical communication.
Senior management meets regularly and the minutes of its meetings are circulated electronically to all staff, regardless of location.
This effort has been adopted throughout the Centre with weekly divisional meetings of section chiefs and similar meetings at the branch level.
Compartmentalization is being tackled through the creation of flex-teams which comprise staff from different subject areas (both normative and operational) who have been brought together to tackle a specific multidisciplinary problem.
The important feature of this arrangement is that it does not require a specific case-by-case consideration and approval at the top level; the initiative of convening a flex-team can be taken at any horizontal level.
Such flexibility is ensured by guidance to managers on the format and workings of flex-teams.
Staff currently have the option to volunteer to join a flex-team.
This option requires the staff member to exercise good judgement in deciding whether his/her expertise and current workload, priorities and deadlines justify membership in a particular flex-team, and requires his/her supervisor to be equally objective and forthcoming in that regard.
Currently, the atmosphere of encouragement and support prevails.
But it is conceivable that frictions might surface when issues like assessments in the Performance Appraisal System for individual input into flex-team work, or possible conflicts between planned work and flex-team assignments and the like, would come to the fore.
OIOS noted with satisfaction that such an eventuality is under consideration and possible incentive schemes, time management arrangements, links between flex-team participation and individual performance appraisals are being discussed.
It is important to translate these discussions into concrete mechanisms, which would ensure that the flex-team format will survive the initial period of enthusiasm and continue as a permanent feature of the work culture.
Personnel management
In 1997, OIOS recommended that the recruitment and promotion of staff under the “L” category (200 series of the Staff Rules) posts should be conducted through a reviewing body in accordance with clearly established criteria and that the assignment of advisers under the 200 series of the Staff Rules to carry out line functions and supervise staff under the 100 series of the Staff Rules should be discontinued (A/51/884, paras.
In the course of the revitalization exercise, proposals for regularization of the “L”/200 series problem were made.
At the time of the inspection, these proposals had still not been transformed into a coordinated strategy.
Unfortunately, Habitat did not seize the opportunity to tackle this issue by clearly establishing which posts are under the 100 series and which are under the 200 series within the framework of the agreed new organizational structure.
OIOS recognizes that “L”/200 series staff comprise two thirds of the total Professional strength, and the two decades-long legacy of disregarding the clear distinction between personnel management under the 200 and 100 series of the Staff Rules by successive administrations does represent a serious challenge to the efforts of the current one to normalize the situation.
While awaiting the outcome of the revitalization exercise OIOS would have expected the Centre to ensure that nothing was done to further complicate the situation.
Most recently, in April 1999, as a result of the provisional implementation of the new organizational structure, “L”/200 series staff were assigned, albeit on an acting basis, to core supervisory functions.
While OIOS acknowledges that, at the time of the inspection, all senior supervisory positions in the Centre were advertised for appointment under the 100 series, it recommends that this exercise should be integrated into an all-encompassing systematic approach to the regularization of the personnel situation.
OIOS noted that appropriate action was recently taken to classify senior posts and issue vacancy announcements.
The Centre should fill these vacancies expeditiously and in full observance of the established rules and procedures.
Management training
The initial recommendation of OIOS was to introduce management training at various levels of management and on-the-job training for administrative staff (A/51/884, para.
71). The current inspection ascertained that administrative staff are being trained in the application of the Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) and, in most cases, also regarding the essential duties of their posts.
The implementation of training activities belongs entirely to UNON; no regular budget funds are allotted to the Centre for that purpose.
As the provider of services, UNON does not bear any responsibility for designing the human development strategy of Habitat; it is obviously the latter's responsibility.
However, because of the perpetual shortage of resources, the Centre prepared no such programme.
OIOS noted with satisfaction that the Staff Development and Training Section of UNON maintains an excellent relationship and receives full support, within available resources, from the Staff Development Services of the Office of Human Resources Management.
Under the Organization-wide programme for upgrading of skills, funds are allocated to Habitat through UNON, based on an annual training plan.
It is expected that the training needs of the Centre are incorporated into the annual training plan.
For the 1998-1999 biennium, $265,000 was allocated through UNON.
Eligible staff of Habitat attended the People Management Programme, either in New York or Nairobi in 1996, as well as the People Management Programme Follow-up Programme held in Nairobi in 1997.
Both the Supervisory Skills Programme and the General Service Development course were held in Nairobi in 1999.
Local trainers have been trained to conduct the General Service Development Programme on an ongoing basis.
With regard to financial management tranining, the centrally coordinated training programme of the Office of Human Resources Management on United Nations budget and finance was conducted in Nairobi from 8 to 10 December 1999 for staff in the Budget and Funds Management Service of UNON, as well as administrative staff of substantive areas within UNEP and Habitat.
At that time, the programme manager from New York and the course facilitator worked with Nairobi-based focal points and provided them with training material to assist them in building local capacity to carry out additional coaching of staff.
Additional training on financial management will be carried out in 2000.
OIOS noted with satisfaction that with respect to the need for managerial culture change, the Office of Human Resources Management expressed readiness to work with the new senior management of Habitat to organize a programme to address this issue in 2000.
Such a programme may be funded out of the regular budget funds for managerial training.
OIOS believes that these positive developments should give impetus to the Centre's management to recognize that the current situation demands comprehensive and far-reaching managerial training, especially in the area of financial management.
A comprehensive and viable plan of action in this regard should be prepared and the problem of the existing resource limitations should be tackled creatively.
Indeed, the revitalization ideology put emphasis on fusion between normative and operational activities, which are now more often than not under single management.
But each of these two functions requires a distinct set of managerial skills, in particular, with regard to the financial management of project-type activities.
Such skills should be mastered through structured training relying on best practices and cutting-edge approaches in each area.
Furthermore, Habitat will shortly be led by a new senior management team with different backgrounds, conceptual vision, personal style, and so forth.
To OIOS this seems an opportune and propitious junction, when the Centre is engaged in transforming its managerial culture, to demonstrate its foresight by envisaging a management training exercise at some point during 2000 to ensure that the new team and its subordinate level of management are guided by the same managerial philosophy and equipped with most effective techniques.
Given that the need for managerial capacity-building is acknowledged, the key question, as in most cases, is how to fund such an exercise.
There could be two possible solutions.
The first one is to allot a certain percentage of staff costs to support management training, to introduce a “training levy” on operational overhead.
That would of course require a rearrangement of other activities financed from the same source.
Another option is to make a well-founded, convincing request to donor countries, through the Committee of Permanent Representatives, for an earmarked contribution, including the programme, scope and budget of the proposed training.
Internal information and staff morale
In its initial review, OIOS recommended that management increase transparency and information on important matters of concern to the staff.
The inspection found that conscientious efforts towards that end were made at the outset of the revitalization exercise.
Morale was boosted by staff involvement in the discussion of the drafts prepared by the Revitalization Team, the establishment of such new channels of communication as the monthly issuance of the Habitat bulletin, distribution via e-mail of the minutes of the Senior Management Group meetings to all staff, both at headquarters and in the field, and divisional electronic bulletin boards.
The meetings and consultations between the Acting Executive Director and the staff had tangible positive impact.
Effective internal communications should comprise dissemination of information from management to the staff, consultations with the staff on the content and meaning of this information, and feedback from the staff on their reaction and understanding.
The OIOS assessment is that while the first component — information from top down — is functioning, the other two are in need of improvement.
It appears that with the passage of time and as the revitalization exercise went into its implementation phase, the issue of maintaining transparent communication became less of a priority on management's agenda.
Communications became one-directional — from management to the staff, and regular consultations on issues of concern to the staff and to secure their feedback ceased to exist.
Meetings with staff representatives now take place rather irregularly and only on request of the staff.
The contents of bulletins and other communications have become limited solely to programmatic issues, while matters of vital interest to the staff such as personnel policy, restructuring and redeployments have been given little or no attention.
This is regrettable, because as the revitalization enters its organizational and administrative phase, as issues of appointments, promotions, reassignments and job security inevitably move to the forefront, the need for open communication with the staff and demonstrable efforts to take their concerns into account becomes acutely felt.
OIOS feels that the recent lapse in dialogue with the staff has negatively affected staff morale.
Delegation of authority
The concluding recommendation of the initial OIOS report was that the Department of Management should monitor more rigorously the authorities delegated to the management of the Centre in order to ensure that they were properly exercised (A/51/884, para.
72). The current inspection ascertained that issues related to delegated authority in human resources management were discussed by the Department of Management with the Acting Executive Director as the need arose.
Such discussions were complemented by a monitoring visit of the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management to Nairobi in June 1999.
As a result of that visit, a human resources management review of the Centre is envisaged.
OIOS also noted that the Department of Management uses IMIS for monitoring Habitat post incumbency reports on a monthly basis and that it is envisaged to establish on-line access to such information.
On a related issue, OIOS was concerned that there was insufficient guidance provided to the new Acting Executive Director at the acceptance of his duties on his authority and terms of reference in regard to the three different entities — Habitat, UNEP and UNON — which he was to head.
OIOS is of the view that induction and formal guidance are essential, given the broad differences in the scope of authorities delegated to the three organizational entities in Nairobi, of which UNEP has the broadest delegation and Habitat has the narrowest.
The revitalization of Habitat was given a solid conceptual start and visionary strategic direction.
It has contributed to decisive advances in focusing the limited resources of the Centre on precisely defined strategic goals and streamlining the organizational structure accordingly.
Regrettably, owing to the historical heritage of serious unresolved problems, reform of financial and personnel management could not keep up with the programmatic revitalization.
That impacted negatively on staff morale and on potential improvements in donors' confidence.
The crucial issue now is not to allow the revitalization momentum to slacken because of weaknesses in the area of financial and human resources management.
The policy commitments to improve these areas must be persistently translated into coherent and effective action.
Financial and personnel management should be moved to the forefront of the ongoing revitalization process.
Effective and far-reaching measures should be developed as soon as possible in regard to both areas, with well-defined milestones, deadlines and personal responsibilities assigned for implementing each item on time.
The normalization of the personnel structure should be carried out without any further delay, in conditions of full transparency, based on established criteria of professional competence, performance and programmatic requirements.
Recommendations*
* Responses by the Centre and the Department of Management appear in italics under the relevant recommendations.
** An internal code used by the Office of Internal Oversight Services.
The Centre accepts this recommendation.
Actions to strengthen the resource base of the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit have already been initiated with the application to a funding partner for a Junior Professional Officer position within the Unit.
Efforts to increase the operating budget of the Unit will also be pursued.
The Programme Support Division should, in consultation with UNON and key donors, review and finalize its financial management information requirements; review the mechanisms and resources required to ensure that financial information is provided in an accurate and timely manner; and examine ways of improving electronic financial data exchanges between regional offices, field projects and Nairobi (SP-99-003-2)** (see paras.
The Centre fully supports the recommendation.
Currently, Programme Management Officers have been given on-line access to financial databases maintained by UNON, and also an experiment is under way to test computerized financial data exchange between Nairobi and the Asia and Pacific Regional Office.
All these initiatives are part of a coordinated approach towards improvement of the financial management of the Centre.
The Centre should give serious consideration to enhancing the effectiveness of its resource mobilization by drawing on the innovative approaches of other United Nations funds and programmes.
The review of the fund-raising concepts and techniques of major successful non-governmental organizations may also produce some useful insights for reviewing the Centre's policies in this regard (SP-99-003-3)** (see paras.
The Centre fully agrees with the recommendation and plans to give it serious consideration.
Contacts have already been made, especially with UNEP and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to learn from their experiences.
This information is being utilized in the currently ongoing preparation of a fund-raising strategy, which will be geared especially towards the diversification of Habitat's funding base and will increase income from voluntary contributions.
The Centre should conduct an in-depth review of the financial sustainability of regional offices and develop measures necessary to ensure such sustainability in the long term.
As part of this review, various ways and means of financial support, including the provision of additional regular budget resources and/or outposting of headquarters personnel to regional offices, should be considered (SP-99-003-4)** (see paras.
The Centre fully supports the recommendation.
Currently, the possible reallocation of regular budget posts to the regional offices is being reviewed.
The Centre should seek specialized assistance from the Archives and Records Management Section of the Office of Central Support Services of the Secretariat in setting up its records and archives management system.
Consideration should be given to seeking a donor contribution if additional resources are necessary (SP-99-003-5)** (see paras.
The Centre accepts the recommendation and is fully aware of the need to address the issue.
Habitat will seek specialized assistance from the relevant United Nations Offices in New York and is planning to mobilize any additional resources that may be required.
Habitat should set a specific deadline for designing effective mechanisms of incentives and safeguards that will encourage both individual participation in flex-teams and support from supervisors for such participation by their staff (SP-99-003-6)** (see paras.
The Centre agrees with this recommendation and will take appropriate measures to implement it.
Systematic action should be taken to reclassify all posts in the new organizational structure according to their levels and types of service and to decide which posts belong to either the 100 or 200 series.
Criteria should be put in place to evaluate the serving staff against the new staffing table, and due consideration should be given to satisfactory performance and length of service.
Appropriate advisory bodies on appointment and promotion should be constituted in accordance with established United Nations policies and procedures (SP-99-003-7)** (see paras.
The Centre informed OIOS that it fully accepted the recommendation and has already taken a number of practical steps towards its implementation, some of which require timely advice and assistance from the Office of Human Resources Management of the Secretariat.
Habitat should (SP-99-003-8)** (see paras.
(a) Carry out a needs assessment with regard to management capacity-building, design an appropriate strategic plan concerning relevant training, and appoint a coordinator for the issue;
(b) Launch an active search for creative solutions to finance the exercise.
The Centre agrees with the recommendation.
It will, however, not be possible to appoint a full-time coordinator for the issue considering the current difficult financial situation of Habitat.
It would be more feasible to designate a focal point for management capacity-building within Habitat.
Management should revive dialogue with the staff, and meet with them on a regular basis, and use participatory channels of communication to mobilize active and dedicated support for revitalization (SP-99-003-9)** (see paras.
The Centre agrees with the recommendation and will intensify the efforts that have been made to improve communication and increase consultation with staff.
Many efforts were made during the second half of 1999 to address personnel issues related to the reduction of some earmarked activities.
Staff morale has been boosted by the commitment from senior management to try and limit staff cuts to the very minimum.
The Department of Management should carry out a review of authority delegated to the three entities in Nairobi with a view to rationalizing the situation (SP-99-003-10)** (see paras.
Consideration should be given to including a briefing on terms of reference and delegation of authority in the induction procedures for newly appointed senior officials (SP-99-003-11)** (see paras.
The Under-Secretary-General for Management stated that this recommendation would be given consideration in the year 2000.

Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations: financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations
Note by the Secretary-General
Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 48/218 B of 29 July 1994, the Secretary-General has the honour to transmit, for the attention of the General Assembly, the attached report, conveyed to him by the Under-Secretary-General, Overseer of the Office of Internal Oversight Services, on the audit of contingent-owned equipment procedures and payments to troop-contributing countries.
The Secretary-General takes note of its findings and concurs with its recommendations.
Report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services on the audit of contingent-owned equipment procedures and payments to troop-contributing countries
Contents
I. Introduction
With the advent of large-scale peacekeeping missions, it became clear that the procedures for determining reimbursements to troop-contributing countries for contingent-owned equipment (COE) had become cumbersome to manage, both for Member States and the Organization.
In section II of its resolution 49/233 of 23 December 1994, the General Assembly authorized the Secretary-General, with the participation of Member States, to proceed with a project to set standards for each category of equipment and to establish rates of reimbursement.
Based on the recommendations of the Phase I, II and III Working Groups on Reimbursement of Contingent-Owned Equipment, revised reimbursement procedures were adopted by the Assembly in its resolution 50/222 of 11 April 1996.
The audit found that the revised COE procedures had largely achieved their objectives of simplifying reimbursements to troop-contributing countries for their contributions of COE to peacekeeping missions.
The revised procedures also enabled the Secretariat to budget more accurately for peacekeeping missions.
Despite these major achievements, the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) found that there were a number of areas where the revised procedures could be further improved in order to optimize economy and efficiency.
The objectives of the audit were to: (a) review progress made in transitioning to the revised procedures in ongoing peacekeeping missions; (b) determine the effectiveness of procedures for negotiating the memorandum of understanding with troop contributors; (c) examine the appropriateness of procedures for reimbursement of COE preparation and inland transport costs; (d) assess the COE and self-sustainment verification reporting procedures; and (e) determine the effectiveness of procedures to reimburse Member States for COE and troop contributions.
The present report incorporates findings on various aspects of the revised COE procedures based on audits of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA), the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) and the United Nations Peace Forces (UNPF).
A draft of the report was made available to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts for their review.
Their comments have been taken into account and are identified by the use of italics.
A. Conversion to the revised procedures
On 1 July 1996, the revised COE procedures came into effect, and all new missions and new contingents in existing missions were required to follow them.
For those missions that started before the revised procedures came into effect, it was intended that the contingents would eventually adopt the revised procedures.
The Phase IV Working Group on Reimbursement of Contingent-Owned Equipment recommended, in its report (A/C.5/52/39, para. 72), that a transitional plan be formulated by the Secretariat for consideration and approval by the General Assembly by the end of 1998.
OIOS found, however, that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations had made only limited progress towards developing a plan for converting contingents to the revised procedures. This situation resulted in some inefficiencies since a dual system of old and revised procedures existed in some missions.
OIOS believes that, in order to realize the efficiency gains that would result from the revised procedures, a plan needs to be promptly finalized and a deadline established for all contingents to facilitate conversion to the revised procedures.
Some of the benefits lost by not implementing the revised procedures were illustrated by the findings of a 1998 OIOS audit of UNIFIL, which the Department had designated as the “model mission” for conversion to the revised COE procedures.
OIOS identified barriers to implementing the revised procedures within the mission which included a general reluctance to adopt the revised procedures.
B. Contingents' self-sustainment capabilities
Another factor restricting the effectiveness of the revised procedures was the inability of all contingents to provide for their self-sustainment.
Situations may arise in missions where the capabilities of contingents to meet these requirements differ.
For example, MINURCA had to provide catering, office facilities, accommodation, and minor engineering because some contingents were unable to sustain themselves.
If contingents are unable to provide for their self-sustainment, missions need to fulfil this requirement.
However, this approach would normally be feasible only if self-sustainment were provided to all contingents in a mission, allowing for economies of scale.
In the opinion of OIOS, such situations need to be taken into account during the mission planning stage and may require an assessment of capabilities in these areas when selecting contingents.
Procedures for negotiating memoranda of understanding need to be reassessed
A central element of the new COE procedures involves the establishment of a memorandum of understanding between the United Nations and the troop-contributing country.
The memorandum outlines, among other things, the specific equipment and other services to be provided by the troop contributor and establishes the reimbursement rate.
The OIOS review of selected contingents found that in all cases they were deployed before the memorandum of understanding had been signed.
The maximum time required to sign the memorandum after the deployment of troops was 30 months and the minimum time required was five months.
The delays resulted from time requirements to clear the memorandum at Headquarters and the subsequent review of the draft memorandum by the concerned troop-contributing countries.
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations therefore needs to reassess internal procedures for reviewing and obtaining clearance for memoranda of understanding with a view to streamlining the process.
The OIOS review of the documentation underlying the memoranda of understanding indicated that there was little systematic recording of the negotiation process.
To ensure an effective negotiating process it is necessary to document each step fully by preparing minutes of meetings and other records of discussions with troop-contributing countries to preserve institutional memory and ensure transparency.
As a result of a 1996 OIOS observation of the negotiation process in UNPF, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations had agreed to, but did not implement, a recommendation requiring that minutes and other formal records of COE negotiations should be maintained.
In order to correct this situation, the Department needs to establish appropriate procedures for carrying out negotiations with the troop contributors and to maintain minutes and other records of meetings.
The Department's Finance Management and Support Service is the focal point for negotiations with the troop-contributing countries.
These negotiations result in a contract between the troop contributor and the Organization for the provision of COE and troops to a peacekeeping mission.
The OIOS review found that the current arrangements did not provide adequate segregation of duties because the Finance Management and Support Service is also responsible for reviewing and certifying troop contributors' claims.
The Department therefore needs to determine the possibility of establishing more appropriate arrangements.
However, the Finance Management and Support Service would still have to be involved in assessing the financial implications resulting from the negotiations.
In its response to the draft report, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations stated that it: “… does not believe there is a conflict of interest by the Finance Management and Support Service being the focal point for memoranda of understanding negotiations and being responsible for processing contingent COE claims, since both the Logistics and Communications Service and the Mission Planning Service are integral parts of the negotiating team.
Furthermore, it seems sensible to consolidate all financial aspects of peacekeeping operations in the Finance Management and Support Service, from assessing the financial implications to the Organization resulting from the negotiations to the processing of the related reimbursement claims”.
COE preparation and inland transportation charges
A. Reimbursement rates need to be established
The COE Manual sets out procedures for preparation of COE for deployment to missions and the subsequent return to its original condition in accordance with standards defined by the United Nations.
The COE Manual indicates that these costs will be assessed and reimbursed on the basis of a claim.
The audit found, however, that the costs charged by troop-contributing countries for similar services varied widely and that claims submitted often lacked sufficient documentation to substantiate payment.
Furthermore, standard reimbursement rates for preparation costs had not been established which, in the view of OIOS, results in arbitrary reimbursement decisions.
The claim, which was received without adequate supporting documentation, was reviewed by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, which indicated that a more realistic estimate of the cost was approximately $750,000 less than the claimed amount.
In such a case the claim should have been returned for additional supporting documentation.
OIOS also reviewed inland transportation charges and found that standard reimbursement rates had not been established.
This complicated the reimbursement process since it was often difficult to assess the reasonableness of the transport rates charged by the troop contributor.
For example, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations had approved an inland transport claim of $131,000, which included charges for administration, travel costs, fuel and lubricants, and vehicle wear and tear.
However, there was no documentation on file to indicate that the claim had been reviewed and on what basis it had been accepted for payment.
In the view of OIOS, a standard formula acceptable to all parties should be developed to reimburse troop contributors for inland transport claims.
B. Non-compliance with financial and procurement rules
Nor had these charges, which may be substantial, followed the Organization's procurement or letter of assist procedures.
Until a standard costing formula is established for reimbursement of these costs to troop contributors, these services should be treated as any other contract for services and be processed under normal procurement or letter of assist procedures.
V. Verification reporting cycle needs to be streamlined
The basic principles of the revised procedures for COE and self-sustainment are simplicity, accountability as well as financial and management control.
However, these principles had not been fully applied to the verification reporting procedures for COE.
OIOS believes the reporting requirements could be streamlined which, in turn, would reduce resource requirements both in missions and at Headquarters.
The COE Manual provides for missions to verify and report to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations at various stages, as set out in the table below:
In the opinion of OIOS, monthly reporting to confirm the serviceability of each category of COE does not add significant value to the monitoring of compliance with the memorandum of understanding.
In addition, the procedure at Headquarters involves regular reviews by five staff members from the General Service level to the Senior Officer level.
The OIOS review of selected monthly verification reports indicated that the processing time normally exceeded one month, and in many cases took substantially longer.
OIOS believes that the monthly reporting requirements could be eliminated if missions reported non-compliance with the memorandum of understanding on an exception basis.
Missions should, however, develop their own internal COE inspection procedures in order to report exceptions to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.
OIOS also believes that the monthly self-sustainment reporting requirement is unnecessary.
An operational readiness report would be sufficient to determine compliance with the requirements of the memorandum of understanding on which reimbursement is based.
There is little additional value gained by having missions verify COE self-sustainment categories monthly.
A. Administrative arrangements need to be fully established
Reviewing and certifying claims in a timely and efficient manner are essential aspects of both the old and revised COE processes.
The audit found, however, that the COE claims process needs significant improvement to ensure the timely forwarding of claims to the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts and the liquidation of obligations.
At the time of the audit, there was a backlog of approximately 185 claims amounting to approximately $463 million. This represented 36 per cent of the total claims backlog.
OIOS believes this situation resulted from a number of factors, including:
• Insufficient staffing to process the claims.
• Lack of adequate work flow and procedures within the Finance Management and Support Section of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.
• The complicated process of verification reporting, which serves as the basis against which claims are assessed.
• Delays in signing memoranda of understanding.
• The backlog resulting from troop-contributing countries having elected to be reimbursed retroactively under the revised COE procedures.
OIOS concluded that the COE claims process needs additional management attention.
The Claims and Information Management Section of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations is responsible for processing COE claims.
At the end of February 1999, this section was required to release 14 gratis personnel who had assisted in processing COE claims.
Since the recent departure of the head of the section for mission assignment, only two staff members remained to deal with COE matters.
Except for the COE Manual, there were few written operating procedures, especially for the revised COE procedures, to guide the unit's work.
The filing system was also inadequate, making it difficult for the section to retrieve information.
In its resolution 52/248 of 26 June 1998, the General Assembly approved the addition of four Professional posts and the redeployment of one General Service-level post to the Claims Administration Unit.
Three of the Professional posts had recently been filled.
However, at the time of writing of this report, the incumbents had not yet reported for duty.
OIOS believes that the remaining posts should be quickly filled to enable timely and orderly claims processing.
A similar recruitment situation existed in the Logistics and Communications Service of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, which is responsible for processing verification reports, among other duties.
Moreover, OIOS believes that consideration should be given to employing temporary assistance personnel to help clear the existing backlog.
B. Basis for reimbursement needs to be re-evaluated
As mentioned previously, one of the expected benefits of the revised COE system was simplified procedures, including those for claims processing.
In this regard, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations had not taken full advantage of the revised procedures.
For example, claims were processed based on verification reports which, as described in paragraphs 19 to 21 above, were unnecessarily cumbersome.
Since the COE reimbursement rates are already included in the memorandum of understanding, procedures could be simplified by processing claims on the basis of exception reporting, with missions forwarding the exception report directly to the Finance Management and Support Service.
This would eliminate the lengthy verification report-processing period currently experienced at Headquarters.
Reimbursement procedures for troop contributions Under the current procedures, missions report monthly troop strength figures directly to the Peacekeeping Financing Division of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts, which processes troop reimbursement claims.
The Office reviews the troop strength figures prior to approving them for payment; however, this fails to provide adequate control since the Office's information is not sufficient to determine if the figures are correct.
OIOS is of the opinion that, in order to establish accountability, the current procedures need to be amended by making mission Chief Administrative Officers responsible for certifying troop strength numbers sent to the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts.
Field audits of peacekeeping missions have also frequently found that internal controls for reporting of troop strength figures were inadequate.
For example, in both UNIFIL and UNDOF the military components were responsible for completing the troop strength reports with little involvement by the civilian administration.
In the opinion of OIOS, for internal controls to be effective, the civilian administration needs to establish systems and procedures for reporting troop strength figures and regularly monitor these reports.
OIOS believes that it would be more appropriate if troop reimbursement claims processing were also performed by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, since it handles the financial aspects of peacekeeping operations.
Having that Department perform this function would consolidate all aspects of peacekeeping claims within one department, thereby improving controls over claims and other financial activities.
Moreover, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has responsibility for establishing procedures in peacekeeping missions.
Making it responsible for troop payments would therefore strengthen the coordination between the mission and Headquarters and provide greater overall control of financial matters.
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations responded to the draft report, and the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts concurred, that: “This matter has been extensively reviewed in the past and we believe that until such time that assessed contributions are paid in full in a timely manner, there are distinct advantages for these functions to remain with the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts.”
Recommendations
OIOS made the following recommendations, which were intended to facilitate implementation of the revised COE procedures, and to improve processing of claims for COE and troop contributions.
Comments received from the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts on the implementation status of the recommendations are summarized below each recommendation.
Recommendation 1
* An internal code used by the Office of Internal Oversight Services.
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations should establish procedures and time-frames for contingents in current missions to convert to the revised COE procedures (AP99/78/5/01).
Implementation status: The Department of Peacekeeping Operations stated that procedures and time-frames for contingents in current missions to convert to the revised COE procedures have been proposed by the Phase IV Working Group on Reimbursement of Contingent-Owned Equipment and are being implemented.
Recommendation 2
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations should ensure, to the extent possible, that uniform self-sustainment arrangements are made for all contingents serving in peacekeeping missions, in order to avoid uneconomical arrangements resulting from the need to provide different levels of service for some contingents (AP99/78/5/02).
Implementation status: OIOS concurs that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has taken adequate steps to implement the recommendation.
Recommendation 3
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations should take steps to ensure that all COE negotiations with troop-contributing countries are fully documented by maintaining minutes of meetings and other records of the negotiations process (AP99/78/5/03).
Implementation status: OIOS concurs that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has taken adequate steps to implement the recommendation.
Recommendation 4
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations should ensure that reimbursements for inland transport and preparation costs incurred by the troop-contributing countries are made in accordance with the relevant United Nations financial and procurement rules.
Furthermore, consideration should be given to establishing standard costing schedules for the reimbursement of these costs (AP99/78/5/04).
As recommended, until such time as standard rates are approved, reimbursement for such services will be effected in accordance with the relevant United Nations financial and procurement rules.
The Phase V Working Group, which met from 24 to 28 January 2000, deferred consideration of these items to its next meeting.
Recommendation 5
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations should streamline the current COE reporting requirements by developing an exception reporting system, resulting in reduced resource requirements and more timely processing of COE claims (AP99/78/5/05).
Implementation status: The need for modifying the COE reporting requirements in the field was earlier recommended by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and efforts are under way to elaborate a system that will satisfy both the Organization and the troop contributors.
Detailed monthly reports on self-sustainment and the serviceability of each category of COE can be replaced with reports on exceptions to be submitted by the missions to the Logistics and Communications Service of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations for verification and, in turn, forwarded to the Finance Management and Support Service for certification.
Recommendation 6
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations should finish processing the approximately $463 million backlog of COE claims due to troop-contributing countries and clear the related unliquidated obligations as soon as possible (AP99/78/5/06).
Implementation status: OIOS concurs that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has taken adequate steps to implement the recommendation.
Recommendation 7
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations should promptly recruit staff, develop standard operating procedures, provide necessary training, and properly maintain records in order to ensure that COE claims are processed quickly and efficiently (AP99/78/5/07).
Implementation status: OIOS concurs that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has taken adequate steps to implement the recommendation.
Recommendation 8
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations should ensure that missions establish appropriate systems and procedures for reporting troop strength figures and regularly monitor the troop strength reports (AP99/78/5/08).
Implementation status: OIOS concurs that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has taken adequate steps to implement the recommendation.
Recommendation 9
The Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts should require that contingent troop strength reports be certified by mission Chief Administrative Officers before the claims are accepted for processing (AP99/78/5/09).
Implementation status: The Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts noted that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has indicated that it would review the system currently in place to determine whether changes are necessary and, if so, how they should be best put in place.
Concomitant with the prospective action by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts stated that it would draw the attention of the Chief Administrative Officers of UNIFIL and UNDOF to the observations of OIOS in paragraph 27 above, and would send a new memorandum to all mission Chief Administrative Officers to remind them of their responsibility and accountability for the preparation, submission and certification of monthly troop strength reports to the Peacekeeping Financing Division of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts.

Death and disability benefits
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the note by the Secretary-General on death and disability benefits (A/C.5/54/47).
During its consideration of the note, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information.
The note by the Secretary-General constitutes the tenth quarterly report submitted in accordance with paragraphs 16 and 17 of General Assembly resolution 51/239 A of 17 June 1997, in which the Assembly noted that as at 19 May 1997 a backlog of 564 death and disability claims awaited processing and requested the Secretary-General to submit quarterly reports on the progress made in clearing the backlog.
As indicated in paragraph 5 of the note, of the original 564 death and disability claims that were awaiting processing as at 19 May 1997, 19 cases remained as at 31 December 1999.
The Advisory Committee was informed that as at 20 February 2000 a further 12 cases had been settled, leaving 7 cases pending out of the original backlogged cases.
It was recommended in paragraph 6 of the note that the tenth quarterly progress report be the last report submitted pursuant to paragraphs 16 and 17 of General Assembly resolution 51/239 A.
In the opinion of the Advisory Committee, the quarterly notes provide valuable information to the General Assembly on the status of death and disability claims.
Therefore, while there is no need to continue to report on the backlog of cases as at 19 May 1997, the Committee recommends that annual reports be submitted on the status of all death and disability claims.
The Advisory Committee is of the view that some of the information contained in the tables annexed to the note is confusing.
Upon enquiry regarding the very large total of 4,833 incidents reported, as indicated in table C, the Committee was informed that the total included all incidents reported and the likelihood was that many of them would not result in claims.
Some, in fact, did not involve injuries that had been incurred in the performance of duties, however, it is felt that it is important for the database to record all reported incidents.
Accordingly, the Committee recommends that a footnote be inserted to the figure for total incidents reported to the effect that the figure includes all reported cases and that not all reported cases will necessarily lead to claims.
The Advisory Committee is also of the opinion that the information contained in the tables could be more complete.
In this connection, the Committee recommends that, in the future, the information given on incidents reported should distinguish between accidents, injuries and deaths.
Tables should also include information on the total number of claims, the number of claims being processed and the number of claims settled, as well as the dollar amounts involved.
In the view of the Committee, some assessment could also be given regarding which incidents are likely to lead to claims.

Review and assessment of the asbestos problem at the United Nations: management of asbestos-containing materials at the United Nations Headquarters buildings
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the asbestos problem at the United Nations Headquarters buildings.
The present report is submitted in accordance with General Assembly resolution 54/249 of 22 December 1999, paragraph 187, in which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit to it during its fifty-fourth session a detailed and comprehensive report addressing the asbestos problem.
During its consideration of the report, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General who provided additional information.
The Committee notes from section III of the report of the Secretary-General (A/54/779) that the document covers the United Nations Headquarters buildings, the UNDC-I and UNDC-II buildings, the former UNITAR building and leased spaces in other buildings in New York.
The Committee notes that the report does not cover buildings at Geneva, Vienna, Nairobi or the locations of the regional commissions since that was not requested in the above-mentioned resolution.
In connection with the buildings at the United Nations Headquarters complex, the Committee notes from paragraph 11 of the report that asbestos-containing materials were extensively used as the buildings were constructed in the early 1950s, when the use of asbestos was widespread.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that since measures to manage asbestos started at United Nations Headquarters, 30 per cent of the asbestos has been removed from the buildings.
The Committee was also informed that with regard to the UNITAR building, 70 per cent of the asbestos has been removed and the remaining 30 per cent remain encapsulated, mainly on the ground floor.
The Committee notes from paragraphs 17 and 31 of the report of the Secretary-General that it is not possible to remove all the asbestos-containing materials from the United Nations Headquarters buildings without vacating and isolating multiple floors and that this would be undertaken in the context of implementing the capital master plan for extensive renovation of the United Nations Headquarters buildings which is to be presented to the legislative bodies in 2000, as and when funding for such a plan has been approved.
With regard to current measures for the management of asbestos, the Committee notes from section VI of the report of the Secretary-General that these include continued encapsulation of the existing asbestos, whereby it poses no health risk to staff, delegates or visitors; semi-annual testing of all air supply and return sources for presence of any asbestos fibres; and the removal of asbestos-containing materials only where the maintenance, alterations, improvement, construction or other activity necessitates its removal.
The Committee was informed that all handling of asbestos had followed standard procedures and unacceptable levels had not entered the air stream.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that between 14 and 15 complaints concerning asbestos are received every year.
On receiving a complaint from staff, a licensed independent contractor is sent to test the area for the presence of any asbestos fibres and the results are made available to staff through the Medical Services Division.
Investigation of past complaints have not led to a positive finding of asbestos fibres in the air stream.
As indicated in paragraph 28 of the report of the Secretary-General, for the 2000-2001 biennium the amount of $1 million has been budgeted for the management of asbestos at United Nations Headquarters.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that since this programme started, $1 million has been budgeted every biennium and expenditures have ranged from $250,000 to $500,000 per year.
The Committee recommends that the General Assembly take note of the report of the Secretary-General and that information be provided on buildings at Geneva, Vienna, Nairobi and the locations of the regional commissions.

Review of the resource requirements for the High-Level Intergovernmental Event for Financing for Development and the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the note by the Secretary-General, contained in document A/C.5/54/50, on the review of the resource requirements for the High-Level Intergovernmental Event for Financing for Development and the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, as requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 104 of section IV of its resolution 54/249 of 23 December 1999.
During its consideration of the matter, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information.
The Committee notes that, regarding the High-Level Intergovernmental Event, the Secretary-General proposes to revert to this matter, after clarification and outcome of the consultations described in paragraph 2 of A/C.5/54/50, when he will be in a better position to address the resource requirements issue.
The Committee agrees with this proposal.
Regarding the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, the Committee notes that the Second Committee, at its 49th meeting, on 14 December 1999, adopted draft resolution A/C.2/54/L.73 by consensus.
A statement of programme budget implications, contained in document A/C.2/54/L.74, was before the Committee.
The report of the Second Committee to the General Assembly, recommending the adoption of resolution A/C.2/54/L.73, is contained in document A/54/587/Add.6.
As indicated in its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 (A/54/7, para. 66) the Advisory Committee reiterates its concern over the continued practice of some intergovernmental bodies of attempting to determine the method of financing of mandates to be approved in the context of substantive resolutions, in contravention of the provisions of General Assembly resolutions 41/213 of 19 December 1986 and 42/211 of 21 December 1987, and recalls the spirit and the letter of section VI of Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, which reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the General Assembly entrusted with the responsibility for administrative and budgetary matters and the role of the Advisory Committee, and expressed concern at the tendency of substantive Committees and other intergovernmental bodies to involve themselves in administrative and budgetary matters.
The Advisory Committee notes that the Fifth Committee, at its 48th and 50th meetings, on 17 and 23 December 1999, considered the programme budget implications contained in A/C.5/54/43 and decided to inform the General Assembly (see A/54/693) that, should it adopt draft resolution A/C.2/54/L.73 contained in the report of the Second Committee (A/54/587/Add.6), additional requirements of $646,400 would arise in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001, under section 11A, Trade and development ($616,400) and section 26, Public information ($30,000).
These resources would represent a charge against the contingency fund and would be considered in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001.
The Advisory Committee notes that the General Assembly, in adopting resolution 54/235 of 23 December 1999, also approved additional resources of $646,400 in the manner mentioned in paragraph 5 above (see A/54/691, para.
14, summary table, section 11A.III. and section 26.III.
(b)). The Advisory Committee also notes further that, in paragraph 14 of resolution 54/235, the General Assembly decided to defray the cost of participation of two government representatives from each least developed country in the meetings of the preparatory committee and the conference itself (estimated at $1,164,500 and $500,500, respectively, in A/C.5/54/43) through the use of extrabudgetary resources.
In the event that those prove insufficient, it requested the Secretary-General to consider all other options, including the use of unspent balances from the regular budget for the biennium 1996-1997 as an exceptional measure.
The Advisory Committee recalls that, in paragraph 7 of its report contained in A/54/7/Add.3, it had recommended that, on an exceptional basis, the special account be maintained and the unspent balance retained until all the activities and programmes outlined in the report of the Secretary-General of 13 May 1998 (A/52/898 and Corr.1) and approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 53/3 of 12 October 1998 were completed.
The Fifth Committee agreed with this recommendation (A/54/691, paras.
Upon inquiry, the Committee was informed that no further expert group meetings had been convened since the issuance of the report of the Secretary-General of 26 October 1999 (A/54/501), and that the actual unspent balance amounted to $587,712, as at 31 December 1999.
The Advisory Committee was also informed that no response has been received as yet to the note verbale sent by the secretariat of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) to all its States members, inviting them to consider the provision of voluntary contributions to defray the costs mentioned in paragraph 7 above.
However, a contribution of two million Finnish marks ($338,764) has been received from the Government of Finland, which has been allocated to supporting the country-level preparatory process for the Third United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries. Given the fact that the preparatory process for the Conference is under way, a major part has already been obligated for those purposes.
The Advisory Committee notes that it is still early to predict the outcome of the appeal.
It recommends, therefore, that the Secretary-General further inform the General Assembly in the context of its second resumed fifty-fourth session on the status of voluntary contributions received.
As indicated in the note of the Secretary-General (A/C.5/54/50, para.
8), an amount of $582,000 would be required to defray the costs of the representatives of the least developed countries to the first session of the Preparatory Committee, to be held in July 2000.
Moreover, the Committee notes and agrees with the proposal that, should there continue to be a shortfall in the availability of extrabudgetary resources for the second preparatory meeting and the Conference itself, the Secretary-General would bring that situation to the attention of the Assembly for appropriate action in the context of its fifty-fifth session.

Review of the resource requirements for the high-level international intergovernmental event on financing for development and the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the note by the Secretary-General on the review of the resource requirements for the high-level international intergovernmental event on financing for development and the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries (A/C.5/54/58), as requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 5 of its resolution 54/258 of 7 April 2000, and the statement on programme budget implications of draft resolution A/54/L.82, submitted in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly (A/C.5/54/59).
During its consideration of the matter, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information.
Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries
The Advisory Committee recalls, as indicated in its previous report (A/54/7/Add.13, para. 7), that in paragraph 14 of its resolution 54/235 of 23 December 1999 the General Assembly decided to defray the cost of participation of two government representatives from each least developed country in the meetings of the Preparatory Committee and the Conference itself (estimated at $1,164,500 and $500,500 respectively; see A/C.5/54/43, para.
10) through the use of extrabudgetary resources. Subsequently the Assembly, in its resolution 54/258, reaffirmed its decision contained in section XIV of its resolution 54/251 of 23 December 1999 to retain the unspent balance from the regular budget for the biennium 1996-1997 and to maintain the special account set up to handle those funds until all activities and programmes approved by the Assembly in its resolution 53/3 of 12 October 1998 were completed.
Furthermore, in its resolution 54/258, while noting with concern that no extrabudgetary resources had been received to date, the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to explore ways of providing the resource requirements for the high-level international intergovernmental event on financing for development and the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries and to report to it at the second part of its resumed fifty-fourth session.
The note by the Secretary-General on the review of resource requirements for the high-level event and the Conference (A/C.5/54/58, para. 3) indicates that no contribution had been received as at that date in response to the note verbale sent on 14 February 2000 by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) to States members.
Further, the note indicates that a balance of $113,000 in the Trust Fund for the Participation of Least Developed Countries in Intergovernmental Meetings had been identified which, with the approval of the General Assembly, could provide a portion of the $582,000 required for the participation of least developed countries in the first session of the Preparatory Committee (ibid., para.
4). The Assembly may wish to take a decision in this regard.
However, even if the amount of $113,000 is made available, a balance of $469,000 would still be required to defray the costs of participation of government representatives of least developed countries in connection with this first session.
The Advisory Committee notes that, in order to meet the additional requirements, the Secretary-General has proposed, in the event that no contributions were received before the opening of the first session, the utilization, on an exceptional basis, of the savings on exchange rates achieved since the beginning of the current year in respect of the regular budget appropriation for UNCTAD (ibid., para.
6). These savings are projected by the Secretary-General to total $700,000 at 31 May 2000 in respect of section 11A of the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001.
The Advisory Committee points out that the procedure proposed in paragraph 6 of the Secretary-General's note is unusual and inadvisable in that it anticipates appropriation of savings resulting from currency fluctuations.
Such savings, if any, would not in fact be known until the performance report for the period in question was prepared.
Moreover, according to representatives of the Secretary-General, the savings to be utilized would be restricted to a specific budget section.
The Committee is of the opinion that the Secretary-General should have requested commitment authority for the $469,000 balance.
Such additional appropriation as would be necessary could then be addressed in the context of the first performance report for the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 and, if desired, consideration could also be given to the use of the contingency fund.
In this connection, the Committee enquired of the representatives of the Secretary-General as to their views on the possibilities for use of the contingency fund in this instance, but did not receive a reply.
As for the resources required for the second session of the Preparatory Committee and the Conference ($1,083,000), the Advisory Committee notes that the Secretary-General proposes to bring the situation to the attention of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session for appropriate action together with any other additional requirements that may be considered necessary in order for UNCTAD to carry out this activity, should there continue to be a shortfall in the availability of extrabudgetary resources.
The Advisory Committee agrees with this proposal.
The Advisory Committee recalls and reiterates its observations and recommendations contained in paragraph 4 of its previous report (A/54/7/Add.13).
High-level international intergovernmental event on financing for development
In connection with the high-level event, the Advisory Committee recalls that in its previous report (ibid., para.
2) it had agreed with the Secretary-General's proposal to revert to the matter of the resource requirements for the event after the clarification of the issues and the holding of the consultations described in his note on the review of resource requirements for the event (A/C.5/54/50, para.
2), when he would be in a better position to address the issue.
The Committee notes that the Preparatory Committee for the high-level event, at its session held on 31 March 2000, recommended that the General Assembly adopt draft resolution A/54/L.82, in which it would, among other things, approve the proposals and recommendations contained in the report of the Bureau of the Preparatory Committee (A/AC.257/6) and decide that the Preparatory Committee should hold two substantive two-week sessions in both the first and second quarters of 2001 at United Nations Headquarters, as indicated in the Secretary-General's statement on programme budget implications (A/C.5/54/59, para.
The statement on the programme budget implications of draft resolution A/54/L.82 indicates that additional requirements of approximately $154,500 would arise under the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 and would provide for the travel and daily subsistence allowance of participants in the consultations of the Bureau of the Preparatory Committee with intergovernmental stakeholders (Bretton Woods institutions, the World Trade Organization and the regional commissions) and other stakeholders (non-governmental organizations and the business sector) (ibid., para.
The Advisory Committee points out the unusual nature of the request made in paragraph 7 of draft resolution A/54/L.82 and cautions that a decision by the General Assembly to approve this would constitute a precedent for the possible use of the regular budget for similar purposes in future.
In any case, with regard to paragraph 3 (a) of the statement of programme budget implications, the Advisory Committee is of the opinion that the Secretariat should have further explored the possibility of conducting the consultations with the intergovernmental stakeholders through videoconferencing, thus generating savings on the $119,400 earmarked for this purpose, and that it should make a point of doing so when similar circumstances arise in future.
With regard to the possibility of using extrabudgetary resources, the Committee was informed that a trust fund was in the process of being established.
Moreover, the Advisory Committee points out that the estimated additional requirements are based on the assumption that all 15 members of the Bureau will seek such reimbursement.
However, to the extent that this is not so, there would be savings.
As regards the holding of the two two-week substantive sessions of the Preparatory Committee, as indicated in paragraph 8 above, the Advisory Committee notes that the Secretary-General stated that the conference-servicing requirements would be met on an as-available basis and that the cost would be met within the overall level of resources approved for conference services for the biennium 2000-2001 (A/C.5/54/59, para.
The Advisory Committee notes from the statement that the Secretary-General is proposing that the General Assembly authorize him to incur the related expenditures up to $154,500 and that it request him to report to the Assembly on the actual requirements for implementing the activities specified in draft resolution A/54/L.82 in the context of the first performance report for the biennium 2000-2001, at which time, if additional resources were required, recourse would be had to the contingency fund (ibid., para.
The Advisory Committee points out that the formulation of paragraph 7 of the Secretary-General's statement is not fully consistent with past procedure or with the requirements of General Assembly resolutions 41/213 of 19 December 1986 and 42/211 of 21 December 1987.
These resolutions require that information be provided on the possibility for redeployment or deferral of existing activities in case the balance remaining in the contingency fund is insufficient.
Moreover, the amount to be appropriated as a charge against the contingency fund has not, in the past, been linked to the outcome of the performance report, as these are two separate exercises.
Accordingly, the Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee inform the Assembly that, should it adopt draft resolution A/54/L.82, additional requirements totalling up to $154,500 would arise under the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001, subject to the procedures of the contingency fund.
The Advisory Committee further notes that the payment of travel and subsistence allowance to the members of the Bureau would imply a waiver of the provisions contained in General Assembly resolution 1798 (XVII) of 11 December 1962 regarding such payment to members of organs and subsidiary organs of the United Nations (ibid., para.
8). The Assembly may wish to take a decision in this regard.
Fifty-fourth session
Agenda item 151 (a)
Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations: financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations
Support account for peacekeeping operations
Report of the Secretary-General

Abbreviations
I. Introduction
The present report contains the proposed requirements for the support account for peacekeeping operations for the 12-month period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001, which amounts to $51,736,600 gross ($44,189,100 net). The requirements represent an increase of $16,849,500 gross ($9,302,000 net) over the current appropriation of $34,887,100.
Of this increase, $7,547,500 is a first time provision for staff assessment pursuant to paragraph 23 of the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions of 1 April 1999 (A/53/895/Add.8).
The remainder of the increase is largely attributable to: the full 12-month cost of the 67 additional support account posts approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 54/234 of 23 December 1999; the related common services costs for the 67 posts; 4 new posts for the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (one P-5 and one General Service post for the Rapid Deployment Management Unit; and one P-3 and one General Service post for the Training Unit); and some general temporary assistance resources to meet surge requirements in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and certain units of the Department of Management.
A vacancy turnover factor of 6.5 per cent for staff in the Professional category and above and 2.5 per cent for General Service and related categories personnel has been applied to all posts.
Details in respect of these requirements are provided in the present report and are summarized below.

Actions to be taken by the General Assembly
The actions to be taken by the General Assembly are as follows:
(a) To approve the support account estimate amounting to $51,736,600 gross ($44,189,100 net) for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001;
(b) To apply the unencumbered balance of $2,179,400 from the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 (inclusive of $601,000 in miscellaneous and interest income) to the resources required for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001;
(c) To prorate the balance of $49,557,200 gross among the individual active peacekeeping operation budgets to meet the requirements of the support account for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001.
Developments in the current period
Following its consideration of the report of the Secretary-General of 4 March 1999 (A/53/854/Add.1) and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/53/901), the General Assembly in resolution 53/12 B of 8 June 1999 approved resources in the amount of $34,887,100 for the support account for peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000, including 400 posts.
In his report, the Secretary-General indicated that, at the time of formulating his proposals, the number of peacekeeping missions had decreased from 16 to 14 and the estimated total budget level for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 amounted to some $843 million.
For the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000, the initial total estimated budget level for all peacekeeping operations, including the support account, was estimated at that stage to be around $650 million.
Although this figure was lower than the gross apportionment for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999, it was pointed out that the actual 1999/00 requirement could increase significantly if new peacekeeping missions were established as a result of ongoing peace initiatives in conflict areas.
In that connection, the Secretary-General would request additional resources should the need arise.
Subsequently, by its resolution 1244 (1999) of 10 June 1999, the Security Council established the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). The unprecedented complex and multifaceted tasks facing UNMIK cover a wide range of specialities ranging from health, education and prison administration to the establishment of a judiciary and a local police force, all of which require specialized backstopping from Headquarters.
On 22 October 1999, in its resolution 1270 (1999), the Security Council established the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and decided that it would take over the substantive civilian and military components of the United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL).
The follow-on mission UNAMSIL entailed deployment of 5,740 military contingent personnel and the emplacement of 50 additional military observers.
Subsequently, in its resolution 1289 (2000) of 7 February 2000, the Council authorized a further increase in military personnel for UNAMSIL up to 11,100.
On the same day, in its resolution 1271 (1999), the Security Council decided to extend the mandate of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA) until 15 February 2000 following the presidential elections.
On 25 October 1999, the Security Council established in its resolution 1272 (1999) the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) with overall responsibility for the administration of the Territory and empowered to exercise all legislative and executive authority, including the administration of justice.
The Mission also included a military and police component of up to 8,950 military contingent personnel, 1,640 civilian police and 200 military observers.
In its resolutions 1258 (1999) of 6 August 1999 and 1279 (1999) of 30 November 1999, the Security Council, inter alia, established the United Nations Organization Mission in the Congo (MONUC), which involved initial deployment of 90 military liaison personnel and 134 civilian personnel.
It requested the Secretary-General to take the administrative steps necessary for the equipping of up to 500 United Nations military observers with a view to facilitating future rapid United Nations deployment as authorized by the Council.
Subsequently, by its resolution 1291 (2000) of 24 February 2000, the Council authorized the expansion of MONUC to consist of up to 5,537 military personnel and appropriate civilian support staff.
In its resolution 1273 (1999) of 5 November 1999, the Council requested the Secretary-General to continue to report regularly on developments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including on the future presence of the United Nations in the country in support of the peace process.
The rapid developments described in paragraphs 7 to 12 above had, by 31 December 1999, increased the budget level for all peacekeeping operations for the current period, 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000, to some $1.4 billion.
Further financing actions that are expected to be taken by the General Assembly in the remaining months of the period will increase this overall level to about $2 billion.
It was on the basis of those developments (see paras.
7 to 13 above) that the Secretary-General on 10 December 1999, submitted a further report (A/54/648) containing revised requirements for the support account for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000.
Following its consideration of the report and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/54/661), the General Assembly on 23 December 1999 approved the establishment of 67 new posts for the period ending 30 June 2000 (resolution 54/243).
In the same resolution, the Assembly authorized the Secretary-General to enter into commitments not exceeding $3,501,600 for the additional staff costs, and requested that he report to the Assembly on the actual additional resource requirements in the context of the performance report for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000.
For the next period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001, despite the completion of four peacekeeping operations (MONUA, the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH), MINURCA and the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT)), the total budget level for all peacekeeping operations is expected to be at least $2 billion.
Unfinished work on old as well as recently closed/completed missions also continues.
Firstly, it is pertinent to note that among the striking features of the new missions to be backstopped are the complexity of their mandates and the large numbers of civilian personnel who, by definition, are not part of formed military units.
Complex mandates constitute a more rigorous challenge, involving a broader range of expertise, to plan operations, to provide them with guidance and to ensure system-wide coordination.
Since many of the areas of expertise involved have never before been part of peacekeeping, it has been necessary to develop new conceptual and practical frameworks for their involvement.
The recruitment of civilians must be conducted on an individual, post-by-post basis, and missions with a larger proportion of civilians require much greater per capita administrative and logistical support than an infantry battalion, for example, which is to some degree self-contained.
A. Rapidly deployable mission headquarters
In its resolutions 53/12 A of 26 October 1998 and 53/12 B of 8 June 1999, the General Assembly requested that a comprehensive review be undertaken of a rapidly deployable mission headquarters.
In its report of 22 June 1995 (A/50/230), the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations had urged the Secretary-General to develop a rapidly deployable headquarters team composed of personnel skilled in essentially military and civilian headquarters functions.
The General Assembly had endorsed that recommendation in its resolution 50/30 dated 6 December 1995.
The rapidly deployable mission headquarters was to consist of three tiers.
The first tier would include a core team of eight personnel, consisting of six military officers, one civilian police officer and one humanitarian affairs officer.
This team would be stationed in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, on stand-by and ready for deployment within seven days of the establishment of a peacekeeping operation.
It would provide to the head of mission an immediate capacity to direct the military and civilian police aspects of the mission, and for liaison with the humanitarian community in the mission area.
The second tier, comprising 29 United Nations political, logistic and administrative Secretariat staff, would be deployed within 14 days of the establishment of an operation.
The third tier, comprising 24 military and administrative/logistic personnel, earmarked by Member States and serving in their home countries, would be deployed within 28 days of the establishment of a mission.
Funding for the rapidly deployable mission headquarters was to come from a trust fund established for that purpose.
In his report of 20 March 1998 (A/52/837 and Corr.1), the Secretary-General informed the General Assembly that voluntary funding at a level necessary to establish the rapidly deployable mission headquarters had not been forthcoming and recommended that the first tier of eight posts be funded under the support account budget.
Subsequently, under its resolution 53/12 A, the General Assembly approved the establishment of two posts for the headquarters, namely the civilian police officer and the humanitarian officer, and requested that the other six posts be provided through the redeployment of existing support account financed Secretariat positions.
In the same resolution, the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to undertake a comprehensive review of the headquarters.
It was not possible to provide the six additional posts for the headquarters through redeployment within the existing support account resources.
In view of the renewed expansion of peacekeeping activities over the past year, the need for a mechanism to ensure the rapid deployment of peacekeeping personnel has become even more acute.
At the same time, recent experience shows that the type of personnel needed to establish a peacekeeping operation has changed, because the nature of peacekeeping itself has evolved.
The Secretariat has undertaken the present review in the light of the recent evolution of peacekeeping and with a view to making the rapidly deployable mission headquarters concept more applicable to current needs.
For the most part, peacekeeping operations today are involved in the settlement of civil conflicts in areas where the structures of government administration have often been severely weakened or destroyed.
In building an enabling environment for peace, such operations must address a wide range of issues.
They must also be deployed quickly in order to avoid the creation of a security and administrative vacuum, which could be filled by undesirable elements.
Today's peacekeeping operations, including those established in the past year (UNMIK, UNTAET, UNAMSIL and MONUC), contain significant political, military, civilian police and civil administration components, mandated to implement core tasks that must begin upon the establishment of an operation.
In this connection, while the military continues to play an essential role in providing security, on the basis of which other activities can take place, the role of the civilian police and civilian expertise has evolved and become increasingly central in the implementation of peacekeeping mandates.
In recent years, the authorized strength of civilian police in peacekeeping has grown from 2,400 in 1995 to nearly 9,000 in 2000.
Their role has also evolved from one of essentially monitoring local police forces to include such functions as training and assisting in the establishment of local police forces, border policing and, in some cases, executive responsibility for law and order.
As police are maintained by Governments on an individual basis and not, like the military, as formed units, it can be very difficult to identify and deploy them quickly.
In many areas, peacekeeping operations today also involve the strengthening of local institutions and, in some cases, responsibility for transitional administrations.
As a result, the number of civilian staff serving peacekeeping operations has grown from some 8,400 in 1995 to over 12,500 in 2000.
The expertise required to carry out civilian tasks includes, inter alia, experienced personnel in the governance of local and State-level administrations and services.
Expertise is also required to set up and run: budgetary and fiscal systems; public utilities and the health and education sectors; judiciary systems (including judges, lawyers, prison guards); demobilization, human rights and humanitarian assistance programmes, etc. Such expertise is found in national and local governments, United Nations specialized agencies and, but not, for the most part, in the United Nations Secretariat.
Furthermore, such personnel must be deployed quickly in order to avoid a vacuum in the administration of an area, which can lead to instability and insecurity.
Hence, profiles of potentially required personnel, and organizations where such expertise can be found, must be developed in advance of the establishment of an operation.
Another critical element for rapid deployment is administration and logistic personnel, including certifying officers, without which a mission cannot function.
Given the nature of United Nations peacekeeping and the methods and procedures of the Organization, only experienced personnel can be deployed during the first phase of the establishment of a mission.
Of course, all of these tasks are under the overall leadership of a special representative of the Secretary-General and are carried out in support of an overall peace process.
It goes without saying that the senior political leadership of a mission, and their essential political support staff, must also be the first elements of deployment in order to consolidate the peace process in its first critical days and to provide overall leadership for the mission.
As illustrated above, the original concept of the rapidly deployable mission headquarters, which assumed that only one mission at a time would be established and included only a limited range of expertise, clearly does not meet the requirements of today's peacekeeping operations.
The Secretariat has, therefore, decided to adjust the concept of the rapidly deployable mission headquarters with the objective of ensuring the rapid deployment of a wide variety of expertise, including military.
The revised system for rapid deployment would utilize the expertise of the United Nations Secretariat and system of agencies and programmes, Member States and non-governmental organizations.
It would include political, military, civilian police and a broad range of civilian experts and logistic and administrative personnel.
Given the multifunctional expertise required, responsibility for the system would be directly under the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations. The modus operandi of the system would be based on arrangements with Member States and relevant organizations for the immediate release, upon the establishment of a peacekeeping operation, of individually pre-selected personnel, who would be deployed for a period of 60 to 90 days.
They would be replaced by more permanent personnel as soon as they could be deployed.
Political personnel.
A decision on the senior political leadership of a mission is made at the highest levels of the United Nations.
As noted above, they must be deployed quickly to consolidate the peace and provide overall leadership and direction for the mission.
Their political staff, who would usually come from within the Secretariat and ongoing peacekeeping operations, must also be deployed quickly in order to support them in this work.
This would also include public information and legal personnel.
Such personnel would be pre-selected for deployment within seven days of the establishment of an operation and would remain in the mission for 60 to 90 days.
A pool of back-up personnel would also be pre-selected to carry out their functions on a temporary basis during their absence.
Military personnel.
The task of the military personnel, who would be immediately deployed, would be to establish a military headquarters and translate broad strategic-level concepts of military operations and plans developed by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations into concrete operational and tactical level orders and instructions.
In order to operate effectively upon deployment, these personnel must have had prior experience as staff officers in United Nations peacekeeping operations or at Headquarters.
It is envisaged that such personnel, working in their national capacity, would be put on standby to be deployed within seven days of the establishment of a peacekeeping operation.
The Secretariat would enter into such arrangements with a number of Member States, thus having the capacity to deploy quickly to more than one mission at a time.
As with military personnel, civilian police personnel experienced in United Nations peacekeeping operations, would be put on standby for deployment within seven days of the establishment of a peacekeeping mandate.
The standby roster would include a number of civilian police specialties.
Again, the Secretariat would seek to enter into such arrangements with a number of Member States, thus having the capacity to deploy quickly to more than one mission at a time.
Civil administration.
Based on past experience, it is envisaged that some 30 separate types of skills may be required depending on the mandate of a particular mission.
Some, but not all, areas of expertise would be immediately required.
In order to ensure the quick deployment of such personnel, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations would develop profiles of expertise required.
Such expertise would come from Member States, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, United Nations agencies and programmes and the international financial institutions.
The necessary experts would be identified in advance and arrangements would be worked out with their parent organizations/ Member States for deployment within seven days of the establishment of a peacekeeping operation.
Administrative and logistics personnel.
As noted above, this category of personnel would usually come from within the Secretariat and ongoing United Nations peacekeeping operations.
It is envisaged that such personnel would be identified in advance and would be ready to be deployed within seven days of the establishment of a peacekeeping operation.
In order to maintain the required capacity in the Secretariat and ongoing missions upon their deployment, a back-up arrangement would be established whereby their functions would be filled on a temporary basis from a pool of pre-selected personnel.
It is envisaged that a small unit would be established in the office of the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations that would be responsible for setting up the new system and ensuring that it functioned effectively.
The Rapid Deployment Management Unit would: (a) establish or refine profiles of personnel required to carry out the full range of tasks necessary to launch any type of peacekeeping operation that might be established by the Security Council; (b) develop and oversee a system for the pre-selection of standby personnel (roster of rapidly deployable personnel); (c) consult with Member States and various organizations in identifying necessary personnel, and develop the appropriate administrative arrangements for their rapid deployment; and (d) monitor emerging requirements and adjust the roster of rapidly deployable personnel to ensure that such needs can be met.
Under the revised rapid deployment concept, the Rapid Deployment Management Unit would comprise four posts: head of office (P-5), humanitarian officer (P-4), civilian police officer (P-4) and one General Service staff.
The P-5 and General Service post represent new posts to be provided in the context of the support account for peacekeeping operations for the period commencing 1 July 2000.
Further details regarding this proposal are provided in paragraph 65 below.
In carrying out its functions, the Rapid Deployment Management Unit would work closely with focal points in the Office of Operations, Military and Civilian Police Division, and the Field Administrative Logistics Division.
In the weeks leading up to the establishment of a potential mission, the Rapid Deployment Management Unit would work particularly closely with the concerned units in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to identify immediate personnel requirements and select personnel from the roster.
As much advance notification as possible would be provided to participating Member States and organizations for the release of personnel.
Nevertheless, it would be clearly understood by all participating in the programme that, in some cases, the United Nations might have very little lead-time to prepare for an operation and, consequently, in such cases the notification period might be extremely tight.
Each participating Member State and organization would be responsible for ensuring that pre-selected staff were kept in a high state of readiness for immediate deployment.
In this connection, a key element in the success of the system would be the conclusion of a binding memorandum of understanding with each participating partner to ensure that staff on the rapid deployment roster were in fact available and ready to be deployed when needed.
Staff selected for possible rapid deployment would continue to perform their current functions when their presence in the field was not required.
In establishing the roster, every effort would be made to include personnel from as wide a geographic range as possible, as well as female candidates.
Under the new concept of rapid deployment, there would be a requirement for appropriate training and familiarization of the personnel involved.
This requirement would be examined by the Rapid Deployment Management Unit and cost-effective means of training and familiarization established.
In requesting a review of the rapidly deployable mission headquarters, the General Assembly specifically requested that it address the following: (a) the difference between the responsibilities of the rapidly deployable mission headquarters and those of the Military Planning Service; (b) further develop the concept of the rapidly deployable mission headquarters; (c) the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions' comments on fragmented planning processes in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations as they relate to the original rapidly deployable mission headquarters concept; and (d) examine the possibility of filling required posts through redeployment of existing support account established posts throughout the Secretariat.
In its report of 6 April 1999 (A/53/901), the Advisory Committee noted that the Secretary-General's report of 4 March 1999 (A/53/854) had clarified the roles of the Military Planning Service and the rapidly deployable mission headquarters, but noted the potential for duplication in the areas of training and planning.
In the Secretary-General's report, it was noted that the primary responsibility of the Military Planning Service was to provide advice on the tasks and possible configuration of military components of new peacekeeping missions and to develop the related concept of operations.
The responsibility of the rapidly deployable mission headquarters, on the other hand, would be to prepare the more detailed plans that were normally established by the military headquarters in the field.
For example, it would translate the strategic-level military concept of operations and the outline plan prepared by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations into operational and tactical-level orders and instructions, including detailed tasking to those who would implement the orders.
Under the revised rapid deployment system, those tasks would also be carried out upon immediate deployment by military officers participating in the roster of rapidly deployable personnel.
It is therefore necessary, as noted above, that such personnel have relevant United Nations experience.
It was envisaged that, when not deployed, the rapidly deployable mission headquarters would also maintain a database on all pre-selected personnel and would assist the training unit in its training of selected standby forces.
Upon further review of this training function, it has been determined that there would, indeed, have been some potential for overlap between the work of the rapidly deployable mission headquarters and the training unit.
This risk would be overcome with the revised system for rapid deployment, as the personnel would remain in their home country.
The present review addresses the General Assembly's request that the Secretariat further develop the concept of the rapidly deployable mission headquarters.
It is envisaged that the new concept would overcome a number of shortcomings inherent in the old concept: (a) unlike the previous system, the revised system would be designed for the maximum flexibility necessary to meet the wide range of personnel requirements of today's peacekeeping operations; (b) unlike the rapidly deployable mission headquarters, which could only be used for one mission at a time, the revised concept would allow for rapid deployment to more than one mission at any given time; (c) the revised system would be more cost-effective in that four, instead of eight posts, would be required; and (d) the revised system would also overcome the inherent constraint of the previous system in that, for political and security considerations, one or more staff in tier one of the rapidly deployable mission headquarters might not have been able to be deployed in a given mission area.
It must be stressed, however, that the success of the revised system would require the active commitment and participation of Member States and relevant organizations.
B. Administrative and budgetary issues
During the 2000/01 period, the Secretariat intends to address a number of administrative and budgetary issues relating to the backstopping of peacekeeping operations at Headquarters, focusing on four priority areas:
(a) A comprehensive review and updating of the Standard Cost Manual for Peacekeeping Operations;
(b) Development of standardized inventory reports that would provide review bodies, in particular, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, with meaningful, timely information in a transparent, user-friendly format;
(c) Review of the current start-up kit concept of the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi in view of the recent upsurge in peacekeeping operations.
The review exercise will examine the existing arrangements in terms of the number and/or composition of the two existing start-up kits as well as the alternative possibility of advance acquisition of certain items of equipment with long delivery times, to be held as reserve stock at the Base;
(d) A review will also be made of the distribution of functional responsibilities between Headquarters and the field.
The level of the resources required and proposed for the next period has been assessed taking into consideration the developments described in the preceding paragraphs.

Overall staffing A. Department of Peacekeeping Operations
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations is responsible for the implementation of the work programme under this section.
The Department acts as the operational arm of the Secretary-General for United Nations peacekeeping operations and is responsible for the conduct, management, direction, planning and preparation of these operations and for providing administrative and logistics support to good offices, preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and humanitarian missions, as required.
Since April 1999, there has been a dramatic increase in the activities of the Department owing to the establishment of three new large-scale missions in East Timor, Kosovo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as a significant expansion of the peacekeeping operations in Sierra Leone.
The complexity of the mandates has placed tremendous demands on the Department. At present, the Department is responsible for 16 peacekeeping operations.

Office of the Under-Secretary-General
Table 6 Posts
Functions
The Office of the Under-Secretary-General directs and controls United Nations peacekeeping operations on behalf of the Secretary-General and formulates policies for peacekeeping operations and operational guidelines based on Security Council mandates.
The Office maintains open communications with Member States on all facets of peacekeeping.
In addition, it maintains liaison with the office of the Spokesman for the Secretary-General and the Department of Public Information and maintains extensive contacts with the media.
In order to promote understanding of United Nations peacekeeping, the staff attend seminars and conferences organized by Governments, intergovernmental organizations and academic institutions.
The Office comprises the immediate Office of the Under-Secretary-General, the Policy and Analysis and Lessons Learned Unit and the Executive Office.
The Policy and Analysis and Lessons Learned Unit acts as a think-tank to provide in-depth research and analyses of emergent questions related to peacekeeping policy, procedure and doctrine.
In addition to the various ad hoc requirements that arise regarding the review of texts and the maintenance of contact with external bodies working on issues of peace and security, priority items on the Unit's policy and analysis agenda can be divided into the following categories: long-term doctrinal research on issues and preparation or clarification of various operational guidelines; service to the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations and support to Member States' series of discussions on the use of police in peacekeeping; and fostering a coherent presentation of peacekeeping policy through provision of inputs to reports and participation in interdepartmental working groups, etc.
With regard to work on doctrine and guidelines, the Unit is exploring such issues as assistance by peacekeeping operations to civilians in armed conflict; guidelines for cooperation between peacekeeping operations and humanitarian and human rights elements; and the role of peacekeeping in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration.
In servicing the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, the Unit, inter alia, provides relevant Secretariat reports, drafts speaking notes, organizes administrative aspects and prepares the text of the Special Committee's report.
With regard to Member States' discussion of the role of police in peacekeeping, the Unit's role has included the formulation of objectives and agendas, preparation of reports and coordination of follow-up.
In terms of fostering a coherent presentation of peacekeeping policy, the Unit participates in such task forces and working groups as the Working Group on Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration of the Executive Committee on Humanitarian Affairs; the initiative on Coordinating Action on Small Arms; the Strategic Planning Network and the Reference Group of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee.
During the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999, the lessons learned programme of work comprised the following items:
(a) The study on disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration carried over from the previous year;
(b) A study on mine clearance in a peacekeeping environment;
(c) A project on the implementation of lessons learned from peacekeeping operations;
(d) A project on the summary of lessons learned from the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)/United Nations Peace Forces (UNPF);
(e) A study of post-United Nations Transition Group (UNTAG) Namibia;
(f) Strengthening the Lessons Learned Resource Centre.
As noted above, the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration study was completed in 1999, as was the project on the implementation of lessons learned from peacekeeping operations, which involved field research in Angola, Georgia and Sierra Leone.
The project on UNPROFOR/UNPF, as well as the studies on post-UNTAG Namibia and mine clearance have advanced and are expected to be completed in 2000.
With regard to the item on strengthening the Lessons Learned Resource Centre, considerable progress has been made with the acquisition of research materials, the development of a database linking ongoing missions, and with the computerization of all resource materials, taking into account the recommendations of the Office of Internal Oversight Services.
The following items featured in the lessons learned work programme for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000:
(a) A project on the application of lessons learned in the field;
(b) A study of lessons learned from civilian police operations in United Nations peacekeeping operations;
(c) A study of lessons learned from mine clearance operations in peacekeeping;
(d) A study on mainstreaming a gender perspective in peacekeeping operations;
(e) The study on post-UNTAG Namibia;
(f) Strengthening the Lessons Learned Resource Centre;
(g) A project on the implementation of the principles and guidelines of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration study, in close cooperation with the Training Unit.
The Executive Office provides financial, personnel and administrative support services to the Department, including responsibility for financial management and performance reporting.
The work of the Executive Office continues to be characterized by the heavy workload relating to the recruitment and placement of staff.

For the current period, the Office of the Under-Secretary-General has 24 posts funded from the support account as shown in table 6 above, and broken down as follows:
Table 8 Posts funded from the support account
For the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001, with the redeployment of the Rapid Deployment Management Unit (formerly known as the rapidly deployable mission headquarters) from the Military and Civilian Police Division, two P-4 posts would be reassigned to the new Unit within the Office of the Under-Secretary-General.
The Unit would be led by a senior civilian officer at the P-5 level supported by one General Service staff.
It is proposed that one P-5 post and one General Service (Other level) post be created for this purpose.
Office of Operations
Table 9 Posts
Functions
The Office of Operations provides executive direction for the implementation of Security Council mandates that establish peacekeeping operations and/or direct the Secretary-General to plan them.
The overall role of the Office of Operations is to act as a dynamic factor in devising, promoting agreement on and implementing solutions to the problems that arise in its area of responsibility.
The ease or difficulty in fulfilling this responsibility depends on a number of factors, including the nature of an operation's mandate, the willingness of the parties to peacefully resolve their dispute and cooperate with the United Nations in carrying out Security Council mandates and the willingness of other parties (regional organizations, interested Member States, etc.) to play their role through the provision of political support, manpower, logistics and the financial resources necessary for the implementation of the peace process.
The upsurge in peacekeeping over the past year has posed significant challenges to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, including the Office of Operations.
The new operations in Kosovo and East Timor have been given unprecedented mandates in terms of executive authority for governance.
Moreover, institution-building activities have become an integral part of many peacekeeping operations.
These tasks have generated new types of challenges in planning, deploying and managing peacekeeping operations.
To help support the implementation of these tasks, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 54/243 of 23 December 1999, additional staff resources were provided to the Office in late 1999 to assist with the planning and management of such activities.
The Office of Operations leads the planning process by providing the overall framework, developing options for courses of action, leading reconnaissance missions to the field and coordinating and integrating inputs from within the Department and from other entities (e.g., military, police, humanitarian, electoral, human rights and such other aspects as logistics, support and staffing requirements) into a comprehensive plan for approval by the Security Council.
The Office has also supported the work of the International Commission of Inquiry in Rwanda and continues to compile information for, and deal with frequent requests from, the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.
It also prepares briefings and responds to ad hoc requests for reports and information by the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Secretary-General, national Governments and other international bodies.
The Office is led by an Assistant Secretary-General and is comprised of three regional divisions (Africa Division, Europe and Latin America Division, and Asia and Middle East Division) and the Situation Centre.
The Assistant Secretary-General, and his front office, is responsible for coordinating the work of the Office of Operations and providing advice on policy and operational issues.
The workload of this office has increased significantly in the past year as a result of the overall upsurge in peacekeeping activities.
The establishment of UNAMSIL on 22 October 1999 and MONUC on 30 November 1999 and their subsequent expansions under Security Council resolutions 1289 (2000) and 1291 (2000), respectively, have further intensified the heavy workload of the Africa Division.
These missions have come at a time when the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) is again facing difficulties in the implementation of the settlement plan.
The Division is still handling residual issues related to Angola.
It is also leading and coordinating contingency planning for a possible operation to help settle the conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia; and is intensifying activities to strengthen African capacity for peacekeeping and cooperation with the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
In addition, staff continue to follow up on numerous issues related to former United Nations operations in Rwanda, Liberia, Somalia and other issues, including queries from Member States, parliaments, international commissions of inquiry and journalists.
All the missions in Africa are multidimensional peacekeeping operations, many of them located in areas of extreme volatility where, as in other regions, the wounds of war are still fresh and where the parties do not yet have the necessary trust to cooperate fully in the implementation of their mandates.
Security for United Nations staff in such areas is often poor, requiring a constant and vigilant watch and close consultation by Headquarters.
Again, because these are multidimensional operations, they require a great deal of consultation and coordination with the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and bilateral partners.
Another complicating characteristic of these operations is that they have to deal with numerous parties on the ground whose positions are constantly shifting and have loose chains of command.
To illustrate the workload involved in the above, during 1999, UNOMSIL, followed by UNAMSIL, required over 300, often lengthy, substantive cables to provide the necessary guidance; 11 meetings with troop contributors, numerous briefings of the Security Council, 40 briefing notes for the Secretary-General and other high-level officials.
This is in addition to unrecorded daily telephone and e-mail communications.
The recently established mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, MONUC, is also a complex mission to manage, as there are over nine parties to the conflict.
This requires the preparation of highly sensitive guidance for the field and recommendations for the Secretary-General.
In the second half of 1999, over 35 background notes to the Secretary-General were prepared; numerous briefing notes were drafted for the Security Council; and over 300 cables were sent to the field to provide substantive guidance, as well as other numerous communications.
The Europe and Latin America Division is responsible for some of the most active peacekeeping operations (UNMIK, the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH), the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG), the United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP) and MIPONUH).
UNMIK, for example, is an unprecedented operation both in terms of its mandate and structure.
The complexity and volume of issues to be addressed on a daily basis generates the heaviest workload in the Division.
The United Nations has essentially been mandated to provide an interim administration for the territory of Kosovo, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
The structure of the Mission is also unique in terms of its cooperative arrangements with regional organizations, which head some of its pillars under the authority of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.
The Mission is highly political, commanding the constant attention of the Security Council.
The management of the Mission involves a great deal of consultation with the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General, as well as consultation and coordination at a senior level with regional organizations (European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)), United Nations agencies and other departments of the Secretariat.
Regular discussions with the Office of Legal Affairs are required to address the unprecedented and very difficult legal issues facing UNMIK.
In the six months between the Mission's establishment and the end of the year, the Division drafted over 400 cables to UNMIK, providing guidance and soliciting information; it also prepared some 200 background notes to the Secretary-General and other officials, and participated in 37 meetings with the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General and briefed the Security Council, donor countries, and other support groups on a weekly, and sometimes daily, basis.
In terms of workload statistics, the establishment of UNMIK has more than doubled the work of the Division.
In addition to its mission-related work, the Division was responsible in 1999 for preparing the report to the General Assembly on Srebrenica (A/54/549).
It is foreseen that the workload connected with the other missions for which the Division is responsible, in particular UNMOP, UNOMIG and UNMIBH, will remain active in the year ahead.
Given recent political developments affecting UNMOP, additional activity in regard to the role of the Chief Military Observer and the related coordination at Headquarters with the Permanent Missions to the United Nations concerned is anticipated, which, it is hoped, will lead to progress in the implementation of the Mission's mandate.
The situation in UNOMIG is likely to remain unstable, given political and security developments in the region, and will continue to require the full attention of the Division.
UNMIBH is currently one of the largest peacekeeping operations, with a number of multidimensional functions.
Its mandate is implemented in close cooperation with other organizations and continues to command the attention of Member States and is closely scrutinized by the Security Council.
This Mission will continue to require close monitoring and coordination at the senior level.
The expected termination of MIPONUH in the coming months and the sensitive work associated with this process — in particular the consultations leading to the establishment of a new mission in Haiti — will also continue to demand the close attention of the Division.
Of the eight operations in the Asia and Middle East Division, five were established around the most long-standing and intractable conflicts in the history of United Nations peacekeeping.
In the coming year, it is foreseen that the three missions in the Arab-Israeli theatre, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), and the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), will see more activity, especially if the resumed negotiations result in agreement.
In the Kashmir region, new military activity between India and Pakistan has meant a state of continuous high-alert for the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP).
In Cyprus, the Secretary-General's initiatives in pursuing a durable solution are concomitant with a more pro-active role for the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) in facilitating community relations on the island through its peacekeeping functions.
These five missions, and the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM), will continue to contribute to stability in their frequently volatile regions.
The Division's workload increased dramatically with the establishment of UNTAET, which has overall responsibility for the administration of East Timor, and is empowered to exercise all legislative and executive authority, including the administration of justice.
It is responsible for the full scope of government functions, which encompass the development of civil and social services, the provision of security and the maintenance of law and order; and the coordination and delivery of humanitarian assistance, rehabilitation and development assistance.
UNTAET is responsible for the training and creation of an East Timorese civil service and a civilian police force.
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations has the lead within the Secretariat for cooperation and coordination with and among the United Nations agencies, the Bretton Woods institutions and donor countries, a responsibility which is performed by the Division through the Task Force on East Timor, interdepartmental daily working-level meetings, and numerous ad hoc meetings in varying configurations.
In addition, there are frequent meetings with Member States individually and in groups.
The Security Council is kept constantly abreast of developments.
The Mission commands high-level interest among Member States and, in the Secretariat, the highest levels are closely involved.
The Situation Centre is responsible for expediting the information flows generated in the field to those responsible in the department, maintaining around-the-clock communications links with all missions, maintaining a crisis management capability and a task force area capable of operating at very short notice.
It also maintains and provides factual information to those in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations involved in peacekeeping planning and operational functions.
For instance, it provides background reports from open sources on the history of a conflict, as well as information on the existing infrastructure and geographic and socio-economic factors related to a possible mission area, which assist in the planning process.
During the past year, the demands on the Situation Centre's services increased rapidly with the establishment of UNMIK, UNTAET, UNAMSIL and MONUC.
For instance, over the past year, the calls received in connection with its 24-hour point of contact for peacekeeping operations increased from 70,000 to 80,000.
The Centre also increased the number of daily reports it produces on specific missions, in particular UNMIK and UNTAET, a service that was introduced in 1998.
Over the past year, some 270 such reports were produced, compared with 30 in 1998.
Another significant development in the work of the Centre over the past year was the introduction of video-conferencing.
The Centre facilitated a total of 96 such conferences in 1999.
Table 10 Situation Centre activity
Workload statistics
The workload statistics for the Office of Operations for the year 1999 reflect the complexity of peacekeeping mandates, especially those of the missions established during the past year.
Multifunctional tasks, addressing a variety of sectoral needs, continue to be an integral part of peacekeeping operations.
The mandates of two of the four multidimensional missions established in the past year — UNMIK and UNTAET — are even broader, including executive authority for governance.
These operations are deployed in areas of civil conflict, which could remain highly volatile.
Given the complexity of their mandates and the sensitivities of the peace process, the Security Council remains actively interested in them, requesting a constant flow of information from the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.
For instance, in the past year, the Department provided almost twice as many oral briefings to the Security Council as it had in 1998 (167 briefings in 1999, compared with 92 in 1998).
Given their nature, the management of these operations also requires very tight coordination within the United Nations system with interested Member States, contributors and donors.
The United Nations cannot implement broad multidimensional mandates on its own.
The Secretariat must call upon others who have the specialized knowledge required to assist in their implementation.
The World Bank and IMF are called upon in the areas of fiscal and economic development; the United Nations specialized agencies and programmes, including the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Trade Organization (ITO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO), etc., all have a contribution to make in accordance with their various mandates.
Close cooperation with regional organizations such as OSCE, European Union, OAU, NATO and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is also required.
Bringing the various agencies and organizations into the structure of a peacekeeping operation, under the overall authority of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, requires constant interaction to ensure the best possible contribution to the political, peace-building and development process.
Such coordination is the responsibility of the Office of Operations.
It is achieved primarily through interdepartmental and inter-agency meetings, as well as meetings with interested Member States, where needs and problems are discussed and consensus on issues reached.
This is reflected in the workload statistics of the Office.
The number of task forces, consisting of various Secretariat departments and United Nations agencies, either chaired by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations or in which the Department participated, more than doubled in the past year, from 146 in 1998 to 297 in 1999.
During the past year, the Department began holding video-conferences to bring together, through the Situation Centre facilities, representatives of various departments and agencies in New York, Geneva and Rome with counterparts from the missions, for daily or weekly coordination and policy-making meetings; 96 such video-conferences were held during the year.
The use of crisis action teams — to share information at the interdepartmental working level and with Member States, especially during times of crisis — also rose, from 35 in 1998 to 60 in 1999.
These statistics show that an assessment of the work of the Office of Operations cannot be captured on the basis of written output alone.
One must also look at the considerable time and work that goes into coordinating the development of procedures, policies and operational guidance required to properly manage the type of operations that have been established in recent years.
Scope of operations — Office of Operations
Quantifiable workload indicators
For the current period, the Office of Operations has 40 posts funded from the support account as shown in table 13 below.
Posts funded from the support account
Unlike the other Divisions, which are headed by Directors at the D-2 level, the post for the head of the Europe and Latin America Division is currently graded at the D-1 level.
This anomaly is owing to historical reasons.
Until the end of 1995, the Division was responsible for the operations in Central America, Haiti and Georgia, but all the activities of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations relating to the Balkans (essentially UNPROFOR) were handled directly by the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations.
With the termination of UNPROFOR and the signing of the Dayton Agreement, responsibility for the new missions in the region (UNMIBH, UNMOP, the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) and the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES)) was placed with the Division.
This led to a tremendous increase in the Division's workload and responsibilities and would have amply justified upgrading the post of Director to the D-2 level; however, this could not be achieved at that time.
As noted above, the establishment of UNMIK in 1999 has meant a further qualitative and quantitative increase in the workload of the Division and has added to the already significant political and managerial responsibilities carried out by the Acting Director.
Hence, the need to correct this anomaly has now become more acute.
The D-1 post in the Division is funded under the regular budget.
For the reasons stated above, it is requested that the General Assembly approve, on an exceptional basis, the upgrading of the D-1 post under the regular budget for the Division to the D-2 level effective 1 July 2000.
At the present time, no additional resources are being requested under the regular budget in connection with this proposal.
Additional requirements would be addressed in the context of the first performance report for the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001.
Office of Logistics Management and Mine Action
Posts
Functions
The Office of Logistics Management and Mine Action provides executive direction and overall coordination of all logistics and administration activities for field missions, including staffing, administration, finance and procurement.
The Office is led by an Assistant Secretary-General and consists of the Field Administration and Logistics Division and the Mine Action Service.
The Field Administration and Logistics Division translates operation plans into support plans and implements the plans.
Support functions typically encompass some 25 discrete areas of activity, most of which require specialized skills. These areas of activity are: communications; electronic data-processing; the field asset control system; contract administration; vehicle fleet management; air support; air safety; movement control; shipment; supplies (water, fuel, food, accoutrements); services contracts; logistic operations; medical support; pouch, mail and administrative services; engineering (infrastructure, prefabs, construction); power generation; water and sanitation; operational demining; staff administration; recruitment; travel; claims; budgets and budget performance; finance management; regulatory framework; and standard operating procedures.
Normally, a surge in activities flowing from the establishment of a new mission affects the performance of some or all of the above areas.
When the surge in activity is owing to the establishment of a large operation requiring a major effort, most of the activities related to older missions are deferred, resulting either in an increased backlog or in reduced oversight, aggravated by the fact that such missions may have lost key personnel in favour of the newly established ones.
As a result of the upsurge in the peacekeeping activities in 1999, the support requirements also increased manifold.
This is a result not only of the sharp increase in the volume of field missions' budgets, numbers of staff and troops, civilian police and military observers, but also because of the growing complexity of the mandates of the new operations.
Consequently, the Division's capacity needs to be enhanced in order to meet additional workload and ensure efficient handling of the whole range of resultant complex logistics and administrative issues.
The Field Administration and Logistics Division consists of three organizational units in addition to the Office of the Director: the Finance Management and Support Service, the Logistics and Communications Service and the Personnel Management and Support Service.
The Office of the Director of the Field Administration and Logistics Division provides overall management, orientation and coordination of the work of the Division.
It initiates reviews by the services of the regulatory framework, including policies, processes and procedures; reviews and approves various initiatives to enhance the capacity and preparedness of the Division to mount field operations and manage them efficiently; maintains liaison with other entities within and outside the Department, as well as with Member States and legislative bodies and participates in intergovernmental meetings.
The Office manages the resources of the Division, ensures that accountability and internal control measures are in place and establishes and reviews requirements for programme monitoring and evaluation.
It coordinates and integrates activities of the Division's organizational units on inter-service issues and issues of concern for all peacekeeping operations.
The Finance Management and Support Service provides financial management and support services to peacekeeping, peacemaking and preventive diplomacy operations and trust funds related to peacekeeping and peacemaking activities from start-up through closure and liquidation.
The Logistics and Communications Service provides the multifaceted interface between plans, mandates and budgets on the one hand, and the practicalities of mounting, sustaining, communicating with and liquidating actual peacekeeping missions on the other.
The Service's tasks are correspondingly complex and varied.
The Logistics and Communications Service is responsible for the development of logistics and communications doctrine and policy, and the provision of expert advice and operational guidance to the field missions on all transport, supply, engineering, communications and electronic data-processing matters.
The Service also develops and maintains the Department's logistics readiness measures to support new or expanding field missions, including the mission start-up kits and the Field Administration and Logistics Division Reserve held at the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi.
It develops plans for logistics support for new or expanding field missions. The Service conducts technical survey missions, specifying equipment, supplies and services, assists in determining financial implications for such missions, and dispatches logistics implementation teams to oversee the critical start-up period for new missions.
The Service determines the need for construction projects; assesses requirements for renovation and development of military and civilian living and working accommodation, water and fuel supply and storage, sanitation and electricity generation in field missions; assesses missions' communications, electronic data-processing, surface transport and air transport requirements, and operates the United Nations aviation safety programme; arranges strategic transport of troops and equipment to and from missions, by air and sea; is responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of the Department's computerized global matériel management database, the field mission logistics control system; provides specialist medical advice for peacekeeping operations; manages the supply of medical goods and services for the Department; determines the method of supply for field mission requirements; and ensures that these requirements are met by transferring assets between missions (including the Field Administration and Logistics Division Reserve), raising requisitions for commercial procurement action, or issuing letters of assist for supply by a Member State.
The Service prepares detailed technical and contractual specifications and proposals for the supply of required goods and services.
It evaluates bids and proposals based on technical criteria, timeliness of delivery and other relevant logistics support aspects.
Logistics and Communications Service also provides logistics evaluation of the contingent-owned equipment and self-sustainment proposals of troop-contributing countries for new and existing missions, and trains field mission staff in the preparation and certification of contingent-owned equipment verification reports, and verifies Contingents' performance against the relevant contingent-owned equipment memoranda of understanding for reimbursement to the troop-contributing country.
The Service prepares statements of work for new contracts, manages signed contracts and letters of assist for the provision of logistics goods and services, and Service section chiefs now act as global asset managers for their specialist ranges of equipment, and have certifying authority for all purchases made against United Nations Headquarters global contracts.
The Personnel Management and Support Service is responsible for anticipating, identifying and meeting the civilian personnel requirements of field missions and ensuring their efficient deployment, management, administration and separation.
The Service plays an important role in the full lifespan of a mission, from planning to implementation and liquidation.
During the budgetary period, the Service remained engaged in identification and determination of staffing requirements for field missions, monitoring and managing of staffing tables, posts and vacancies; review, selection, appointment and assignment of all international civilian staff; arranging travel to field missions for all international civilian personnel, military observers and civilian police; administration of contracts, salaries and benefits for all international civilian staff serving in field missions; processing initial appointment, assignment, extension and separation of the staff members serving in the field; monitoring mission administration of locally recruited staff; implementation of the Integrated Management Information System (IMIS), development and maintenance of information management systems throughout the Service and in coordination with field missions; advising missions on general information for field administration and personnel policy and assisting in interpretation of staff rules and administrative issuances; contributing to development of organizational personnel policy, including participation in human resources management task forces and working groups, and conducting staff management consultations on personnel policies applicable to field missions; developing and maintaining up-to-date rosters of applicants for priority occupational groups; development, implementation and management of career development, including learning and training programmes for field mission personnel; development and management of a staff welfare programme by ensuring substantive, psychological and medical preparedness of deployed personnel and adequate stress management through development of policies, such as occasional recuperation breaks, conducive to health and well-being of staff; maintaining liaison with the United Nations Security Coordinator on administrative measures relating to security and safety of field personnel; undertaking all necessary notification and administrative arrangements in respect of civilian injuries and casualties in the field; and undertaking visits to the field as necessary for mission planning, start-up, support and monitoring and assessment of the exercise of delegated authority.
The Mine Action Service is the focal point within the United Nations system for all landmine-related issues.
The Service is responsible for the development of policies, procedures, standards and technical guidelines for all aspects of mine action, including clearance, dangerous area reduction and mine awareness in support of field missions authorized by the Security Council.
The Service participates in pre-mission planning and in-theater assessment, the establishment of the mine action coordination function and ongoing quality assurance monitoring.
In 1999, the Service responded to Security Council requirements for the establishment of the mine action capacity in Kosovo and Sierra Leone as well as assessment of the mine action situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In 2000, it is anticipated that a mine action response will be required for Ethiopia, Eritrea, Western Sahara and Guinea-Bissau among other possible missions.

It is proposed that all 232 posts be retained for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001.
Military and Civilian Police Division
Table 19 Posts
Functions
The Military and Civilian Police Division provides advice on all military and civilian police matters as and when required.
Functions include preparing operational plans for the military and/or civilian police components of the missions, including contingency plans for potential, ongoing or closing peacekeeping missions; development of procedures and methods to be applied to concrete situations; tracking the daily operations of the military and civilian police components of the ongoing field missions; providing advice to the force headquarters; administration of rotations; replacements and repatriations of military and civilian police personnel deployed in the mission areas; maintaining the United Nations standby arrangements system, promoting and assisting the coordination of peacekeeping training activities of Member States; providing support (practical and conceptual) to training in order to enhance the readiness of Member States; and providing an immediate capacity to newly established missions with which to begin the mandate's implementation.
The Military and Civilian Police Division is headed by the Military Adviser and consists of the Office of the Military Adviser, the Military Planning Service, the Civilian Police Unit and the Training Unit.
Workload statistics
Table 20 Scope of operations supported by the Military and Civilian Police Division
a Projected.
Quantifiable workload indicators
a Projected.
The current staff resources of the Military and Civilian Police Division total 51 posts, broken down as follows:
Table 22 Posts
With regard to the rapidly deployable mission headquarters, it is proposed that overall responsibility for the operation of the unit (renamed the Rapid Deployment Management Unit) be transferred to the Office of the Under-Secretary-General.
Accordingly, two P-4 posts assigned to the former rapidly deployable mission headquarters would be redeployed from the Office of the Military and Civilian Police Division to the Office of the Under-Secretary-General as part of the transfer of functions to the Rapid Deployment Management Unit.
With regard to the Training Unit, limited staff resources have restricted the ability of the Unit to meet the training demands in support of peacekeeping activities.
Participation in training seminars and exercises outside New York has been hampered by the lack of staff, as has the capacity to produce, edit, review and arrange for the translation of training material and other publications.
The result has been an inability to adequately support and encourage overall readiness and participation by Member States in United Nations field missions.
During the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001, the Training Unit aims to recover a significant proportion of this lost capacity.
The proposed work programme of the Training Unit includes action to reduce the backlog in the production of support material and an enhancement in training support to Member States peacekeeping readiness; an increase in training activities conducted by the Training Unit, as well as increased participation in training events conducted by Member States; the development of partnerships with regional organizations and the strengthening of links with regional and national training institutions.
To effectively execute the work of the Training Unit and enhance the training capacity of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in support of field missions, additional staff resources for training are a priority requirement.
Accordingly, it is proposed that the Training Unit be strengthened with the addition of one training officer (one P-3 post) and one publications assistant (General Service level post).
Taking into account the proposals outlined in paragraphs 110 to 113 above, for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001, the Military and Civilian Police Division would have a total complement of 51 support account posts.
Department of Peacekeeping Operations: non-post requirements
General temporary assistance.
A provision in the amount of $569,400 is required to provide the Department with temporary assistance of staff as follows:
(a) For staff on maternity leave or extended sick leave and to meet peak workload demands ($100,000);
(b) For a number of tasks within the Field Administration and Logistics Division amounting to 48 work-months at the Professional level as indicated below ($469,400).
It is expected that the number of such deployments would be over 1,200 by the third quarter of 2000.
43 work-months at the P-3 level are required in order to ensure processing of backlogs in the following areas: (a) Surface transport.
18 work-months for the processing of letters of assist, the review of mission vehicle establishments, the development of operational support manual vehicle operations volume and the development of a training module for motor transport officers;
4 work-months for the processing of Headquarters Committee on Contracts cases for construction of works at UNIFIL and the renovation of premises at UNMIBH and UNTAET, monitoring and verifying field missions' compliance to enter all engineering assets in the field asset control system database, the collection and analysis of field missions' utilities consumption data, rates and total expenditures, the resolution of a contractor's claim associated with the supply of installation of an 800-man camp for the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) and the organization and implementation of a seven-day generator mechanics' training workshop at the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi.
Consultants and experts.
No provision is made under this heading.
An estimated provision of $120,000 is required for the travel of staff of the Department:
(a) To accompany the Secretary-General on official visits ($15,000);
(b) For field technical survey/assessment missions to non-mission areas in connection with potential operations ($40,000);
(c) To assist Member States in interviewing and testing potential additional or replacement officers prior to their deployment, in order to ensure that suitably qualified police officers are deployed to the field, which would obviate the expense of repatriation costs for unqualified officers ($25,000);
(d) To attend seminars and conferences, to visit troop-contributing countries and to visit non-mission areas for general logistical requirements ($30,000);
(e) In response to a request for staff of the Situation Centre to assist in the evaluation of OAU crisis management procedures ($10,000).
Training Unit.
An estimated $389,000 is required to fund training activities carried out by the Department's Training Unit:
(a) Train the trainers.
The United Nations training courses for military and civilian police national trainers on peacekeeping, human rights and humanitarian assistance are held jointly with the Centre for Human Rights, UNHCR and the United Nations Staff College in Turin, Italy.
Subsequent courses will be limited to one per year in Turin and another in a country willing to host the same, as a means of keeping knowledge of peacekeeping activities current and of offering refresher courses.
New subject matters such as gender mainstreaming and a more comprehensive presentation on the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) introduced in the last course.
Lecturers with peacekeeping experience as well as previous students of the course are being utilized to better prepare future trainers of national contingents that are to be deployed to peacekeeping missions;
(b) United Nations training assistance team seminars.
The seminars, first introduced four years ago, have proved to be an effective means of having training advisers on standby, ready for deployment to any Member State in need of peacekeeping training assistance.
There are currently 200 members of this team from over 100 Member States in all regions.
Active membership, however, is limited to two years, during and after which courses will be conducted in each region to train new members.
This will ensure the infusion of fresh knowledge and experience.
Furthermore, as more and more countries express a desire to participate, either for the first time or in an increased capacity in peacekeeping missions, the need to conduct more courses in various regions has become imperative;
(c) Simulation peacekeeping operations exercises.
Member States involved in simulation exercises, which are usually participated in by multinational contingents, frequently seek the assistance of the Training Unit in providing a programme syllabus, accreditation, lecturers and other participants to the event.
This type of exercise provides hands-on experience with real-time scenarios of a peacekeeping environment being acted out by the participants.
Positive feedback from peacekeepers who have benefited from this kind of exercises has increased the demand and a number of Member States have expressed the desire to host the exercises;
(d) Peacekeeping operations workshops and training assistance to Member States.
Various national and regional peacekeeping training centres have worked in close cooperation with the Training Unit over the years and continue to conduct training courses on a regular basis.
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations participation is essential to ensure the uniformity of content and standards, as well as to reiterate the United Nations commitment to enhancing the peacekeeping capacity of countries where it is requested;
There is now a requirement to include training in cultural and gender sensitivity in future mission readiness training programmes.
Adequate resources are necessary to conduct pre-deployment training tailored to particular missions, especially as new ones are under way.
An example of a pre-mission training took place prior to the deployment of military liaison officers in connection with the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Training should include information on local sensitivities;
(f) Publications.
The Training Unit intends to translate all relevant publications into the official languages of the United Nations.
Currently, a number of instructional texts are available but only in English and French, except for certain key documents that peacekeepers carry on their person, such as the United Nations Code of Conduct, which are available in all official United Nations languages.
As in previous years, orders for reprinting as well as printing of updated versions of training documents will continue as the need arises;
(g) Planned activities are as follows:
Rental of premises.
Resource requirements for the Peacekeeping Financing Division of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts are centralized under the Department of Management.
Rental of office equipment.
A provision of $72,000 is made for the rental of photocopy machines.
The Department currently holds an inventory of 22 photocopy machines.
It is proposed that rental costs in respect of nine existing photocopy machines at a unit cost of $8,000 per year be provided for during 2000/01.
Communications. An amount of $345,800 is proposed for communications links, including telephone, telefax and cable charges, between the Department and the field missions.
The estimate is based on the standard rate of $1,300 per person per year for 266 persons.
While it is proposed that the Department be provided with 351 posts funded from the support account, general operating expenses are based on the reduced figure of 266 posts.
As in past practice, operating resource requirements for the remaining 85 support account posts are included within the respective provisions under the regular budget.
Maintenance of office automation equipment.
Under the global maintenance contract negotiated by the Information Technology Services Division of the Office of Central Support Services for the maintenance of the electronic data-processing equipment a provision of $266,000 is made based on a cost of $1,000 per desktop, which includes the associated servers and networks, for 266 computers.
In addition, provision is made for $53,200 in order to upgrade desktop software based on unit costs of $200 per computer.
Supplies and materials.
Estimated requirements of $44,100 under this heading relate to office supplies based on the standard rate of $100 per person per annum for 266 staff ($26,600) and for copy paper in respect of nine photocopying machines based on an average monthly cost of $162 per copier ($17,500).
Recurring provision for subscriptions (major daily newspapers, weekly magazines and quarterly journals) and one-time costs for the acquisition of technical handbooks have been sought from the regular budget.
Office furniture and equipment.
An amount of $30,000 is proposed under this heading.
The Department currently occupies four floors of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research building, all of which are undergoing renovation.
This provision is to enable the purchase of additional office furniture and equipment to enhance the utility of the renovated areas which will be, in the main, open-plan.
Electronic data-processing equipment.
Provision is made for data-processing equipment as follows:
(a) Replacement of existing equipment ($164,500).
As stated at paragraph 85 of the report of the Secretary-General containing support account proposals for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 (A/53/854/Add.1), it was projected that as none of the Department's desktop computers required upgrading over the current period and that the replacement programme should be implemented effective July 2000.
It is estimated that the Department's electronic data-processing equipment has a useful life of four years and therefore 25 per cent should be replaced annually.
Provision is therefore made for the replacement of 51 desktop computers and monitors ($76,500), 23 notebooks ($57,500) and 61 printers ($30,500);
(b) Additional requirements relating to an increase in posts for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 ($51,000).
In its report of 10 December 1999 (A/54/661), the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions noted that non-staffing requirements had not been requested for the additional 67 posts proposed by the Secretary-General in his report of 10 December 1999 (A/54/648).
Accordingly, resources are now requested for 30 desktop computers and monitors ($45,000) and 12 printers ($6,000) to accommodate the additional staff in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations;
(c) Other electronic-data processing equipment ($97,500).
Provision is requested to cover the cost of equipment that is not covered by the replacement programme, comprising one additional server ($30,000), two 12 port multi dial-in routers ($9,000) and 2 projectors ($8,500).
Additional software is also required for storing and manipulating the Department's documents and image repository, for performing specific activities, including server back-up, notes server management, data migration tools, Visual Basic for front-ending to the reports server, enterprise software for integrating Microsoft Office products with data warehousing for use with powerful report-writing software and report-writing software, and software license upgrades, which include Visio, Install Shield Pro 2000, Chimney Sweep Pro and Microsoft Project ($50,000).

Table 54 Activities
Three posts are currently funded by the support account in the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator: one P-5 post (senior security coordination officer) and two P-4 posts (security coordination officer and stress counsellor).
The P-5 post and one P-4 post were approved by the General Assembly on 23 December 1999 (resolution 54/243) in connection with the increased security requirements resulting from the surge in peacekeeping activity associated with the establishment of new missions in Kosovo and East Timor and the expansion of the peacekeeping operation in Sierra Leone.
To adequately ensure the safety and security of United Nations staff serving with peacekeeping operations in the field, it is proposed to maintain all three posts for the 12-month period beginning 1 July 2000.
General operating expenses.
An estimated $20,100 would provide for the following expenditures: $15,000 for communications, including long-distance telephone and facsimile charges and cable charges; and $5,100 for maintenance of office automation equipment.
Supplies and equipment.
An estimated $1,500 would provide for the purchase of supplies for office automation equipment and general supplies.
Electronic data-processing equipment.
Total estimated requirements of $7,100 would provide for additional equipment, including two desktop computers ($3,000), two monitors ($600), two printers ($1,000) and one notebook computer ($2,500).

(United States dollars)
Overall staffing
Functions
The Executive Office of the Secretary-General has a direct involvement in the peacekeeping role of the Organization.
The Office is required to assist the Secretary-General in providing policy direction to Departments with direct responsibility for peacekeeping and ensuring effective coordination of the activities of the United Nations which impact on or contribute to peacekeeping.
The Executive Office of the Secretary-General has three posts (one D-2, one P-5 and one General Service level) financed from the support account.
The incumbents of the D-2 and the P-5 posts are charged with providing direct support to the Secretary-General in discharging his responsibilities.
To this end, they focus on matters that require the Secretary-General's personal attention.
They follow developments in the Security Council's work and bring to the attention of the Secretary-General those matters that relate, in particular, to peacekeeping operations, and conveys to the concerned departments the Secretary-General's views and decisions.

Overtime. It is proposed that a provision of $5,000 be maintained to cover overtime costs to allow the Executive Office to meet deadlines inherent in the nature of work at Headquarters pertaining to backstopping required by peacekeeping operations.
(United States dollars)
Overall staffing
Functions
The Office of Legal Affairs has primary responsibility for ensuring that necessary and appropriate legal regimes and mandates are established for all peacekeeping operations and good offices, missions undertaken by the United Nations.
In this connection, the Office of Legal Affairs provides a wide range of legal services and assistance for backstopping the peacekeeping operations of the Organization.
Such legal services and assistance are primarily, if not wholly, provided by two divisions within the department: the Office of the Legal Counsel and the General Legal Division.
The Office of the Legal Counsel is concerned mainly with the legal issues arising from the policy and political decision taken by the Organization, as well as the legal framework for the establishment of peacekeeping missions.
The General Legal Division provides overall support to the operational and commercial activities of the peacekeeping missions, including resolving the large numbers of claims arising from such activities.
Workload statistics
A. Percentage of actual hours spent on assigned matters versus deployed staff hours for all General Legal Division posts during 1997
B. Summary of actual hours logged in support of peacekeeping operations by Professional staff
C. Percentage of actual hours spent on assigned matters versus deployed staff hours for all General Legal Division posts during 1998
D. Percentage of actual time spent on providing support to peacekeeping operations versus total budgeted staff hours deployed by the General Legal Division
E. Percentage of actual hours spent on assigned matters versus deployed staff hours for all General Legal Division posts during 1999
The Office of Legal Affairs currently has five Professional posts (one P-5, three P-4 and one P-3) funded from the support account.
One P-4 post is assigned to the office of the Legal Counsel, while the remaining four posts (one P-5, two P-4 and one P-3) are located within General Legal Division.
Of the five posts financed under the support account, two P-4 posts were approved by the General Assembly in December 1999 to assist the Office of Legal Affairs with the additional workload arising from new missions in Kosovo and East Timor and the expansion of the operation in Sierra Leone.
It is proposed that the current number of support account posts provided for the Office of Legal Affairs be maintained for the period from 1 July 2000 through 30 June 2001.
General Legal Division: non-post resources
A provision of $500 is requested for office supplies.
F. Office of Internal Oversight Services
Table 60 Overall requirements (United States dollars)
The Office of Internal Oversight Services provides support to United Nations peacekeeping operations through its Audit and Management Consulting Division and the Investigations Section.
Functions
The Audit and Management Consulting Division is responsible, inter alia, for the audit of all peacekeeping and special missions, the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, as well as the functional areas administered by the Field Administration and Logistics Division, Department of Peacekeeping Operations, at Headquarters.
The functions performed by the Division include monitoring the implementation of audit recommendations, the provision of management consulting services as well as advising on those issues related to peacekeeping operations that fall under the audit responsibility of the Audit and Management Consulting Division.
With regard to the work of the Investigations Section, the role of the Section is primarily reactive, that is the Section reacts to reports received, pursuant to paragraph 18 of Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/273, of allegations of violations of United Nations rules, regulations and administrative issuances, as well as misconduct, mismanagement, waste of resources and abuse of authority.
Approximately one fifth of the cases received by the Investigations Section relate to peacekeeping activities.
Workload statistics
As shown in the table below, over 1,500 audit-days were actually spent on peacekeeping audits for the 6-month period from 1 July through 31 December 1999.
A. Audit-days spent by the Audit and Management Consulting Division in the audit of peacekeeping operations and number of related audit reports issued during the period from 1 January to 31 December 1999
B. Audit-days estimated by the Audit and Management Consulting Division for the audit of peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001
Given the relatively short history and the particular “reactive” mandate provisions governing the work of the Investigations Section, the Section cannot provide an accurate projection of the number of reports it might receive or estimate the number of person-days it will require to address reports made to the Section in the future.
On the basis of work performed by the Section in 1999, over 1,000 person-days would be required by the Section to attend to peacekeeping matters during the next 12-month period.
However, with the establishment of new peacekeeping operations in Kosovo, East Timor and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the expansion of the mission in Sierra Leone, it is estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 person-days will be expended on peacekeeping matters during the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001.
According to its audit plan for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001, the Audit and Management Consulting Division seeks to audit 10 peacekeeping missions and the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, as well as peacekeeping-related functions based in Headquarters.
As detailed in the preceding table, approximately 1,600 audit-days are required to provide minimum coverage to execute the audit plan.
The Office of Internal Oversight Services has a total of 12 posts funded from the support account.
Eleven posts are assigned to the Audit and Management Consulting Division (1 P-5, 6 P-4, 3 P-3 and 1 General Service level) while 1 P-4 post is identified for the position of investigator in the Investigations Section.
It is proposed that the current staffing level funded from the support account be maintained for the Office of Internal Oversight Services for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001.
Travel. It is proposed that a provision of $40,000 be provided for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 to cover the cost of investigation travel by staff of the Office of Internal Oversight Services.
Office equipment.
A provision of $10,000 is requested for the acquisition of office automation equipment for the use of staff of the Audit and Management Consulting Division and the Investigations Section.
Communications. Provision is made in the amount of $8,000 for telephone and facsimile charges relating to communication between Headquarters and peacekeeping missions as required during the course of field audits.
V. Outstanding tasks remaining for completed and closed peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001

Financial reports and audited financial statements and Reports of the Board of Auditors
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered, in accordance with financial regulation 12.11, the report of the Board of Auditors on the financial report and audited financial statements for the United Nations peacekeeping operations for the 12-month period ending 30 June 1999.1 The Committee had also before it a report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors concerning United Nations peacekeeping operations for the period ending 30 June 1999 (A/54/748).
The Advisory Committee recalls its opinion reflected in its report on United Nations peacekeeping operations (A/53/940, para.
2) that it would be useful for the Committee to have the report of the Board of Auditors available to it by the beginning of February so that the Board's findings and recommendations could be taken into account when the Committee considers the budgets for peacekeeping operations.
The Committee is pleased to note that the report of the Board of Auditors, albeit in an advance form and in one language only, was submitted to the Committee at the beginning of its current session.
The Advisory Committee welcomes the fact that the Administration has implemented all the recommendations of the Board of Auditors for the 18-month period ending 30 June 19972 and the Board confirms in paragraph 9 of its report3 that there are no outstanding matters.
The Advisory Committee notes from the summary of the Board's findings that in addition to the audit of peacekeeping operations at Headquarters, it has conducted a total of 27 audits, including 6 special audits requested by the General Assembly.
In respect of the latter audits, the Committee requests that the Board of Auditors monitor this aspect of its work on a regular basis.
The Board should report to the Assembly through the Advisory Committee, as appropriate, on the implications of such ad hoc requests for special audits on its ability to set audit priorities, including having sufficient lead time for the preparation of audit reports.
Financial issues are covered in paragraphs 14 to 53 of the Board's report.3 With regard to the United Nations accounting standards (para.
14), the Advisory Committee recalls that in paragraph 18 of its report contained in document A/53/513, it expressed its understanding that steps were under way in the Consultative Committee on Administrative Questions (Financial and Budgetary Questions) (CCAQ) (FB) to initiate a review of the standards.
With regard to inter-office vouchers (see para.
18 of the Board's report), the Advisory Committee notes and welcomes the reduction in inter-office transactions for peacekeeping operations.
It is recalled that the Committee called for a system-wide approach on the issue of more efficient methods of clearing inter-office vouchers, including the use of new technology (see A/53/940, para.
5). The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that CCAQ (FB) had discussed this issue at its meeting in August/September 1999 and that further discussions would be held in the CCAQ Working Party meeting and the formal CCAQ meeting in 2000; in the meantime, the Secretariat is initiating pilot projects on reducing the amount of supporting documentation required for the processing of inter-office vouchers between the various offices, including offices away from Headquarters.
Moreover, Headquarters is also in the process of implementing a scanning project whereby supporting documents are scanned at the time of processing and can then be sent in an electronic format to various offices to facilitate the process.
The Advisory Committee was also informed, upon enquiry, that the Secretariat's practice regarding the reimbursement of troop-contributing countries for personnel and equipment is as follows:
(a) After taking into account the immediate requirement of three to four months' operating cash for each of the active peacekeeping missions, and based on accumulated available cash in each of their accounts, the Secretariat in recent years has, on average, made progress payments to troop-contributing countries for troop costs four times a year and for contingent-owned equipment twice a year.
Such progress payments are made on an equal prorated basis to all troop-contributing countries.
Where significant arrearage payments are received in the course of the year, additional progress payments are also made in respect of the missions to which such arrearage payments are applied.
In accordance also with the recommendations of the Board of Auditors, progress payments are made on the basis of claims that have been certified;
(b) Death and disability claims are processed on a case-by-case basis and are in almost all cases paid when they are certified;
(c) Letters of assist are also processed on a case-by-case basis and, subject to availability of cash, are also paid when they are certified.
As indicated by the Advisory Committee, the non-recognition of claims of troop-contributing countries is a serious deficiency that needs urgent attention by the Administration (A/53/940, para.
6). As can be seen from paragraphs 25 to 30 of the Board's report, the problem persists.
The Committee welcomes the measures indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors (A/54/748, paras.
6-8). The Committee also understands that this problem would be minimized by the full implementation of the new contingent-owned equipment reimbursement arrangements.
The Committee sought additional information on the treatment in the accounts of the $149 million referred to in paragraph 26 of the report of the Board of Auditors.
The representatives of the Secretary-General clarified that a report on this issue would be submitted to the General Assembly in due course.
The Committee requests that in his report the Secretary-General clearly explain the practice of the United Nations regarding accounts payable and contingent liabilities.
The Committee expects that this report will be available as soon as possible.
The Advisory Committee welcomes the fact that measures were introduced, effective 1 July 1999, to enhance transparency in the recording of information on valid obligation documents to facilitate more effective monitoring of unliquidated obligations (see para.
34 of the report of the Board of Auditors).
The Committee stresses in this connection the importance of the timely settlement of claims with Governments participating in United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The Advisory Committee notes with concern the large overdue amounts related to staff and non-staff activities (see ibid., paras.
40-42). With regard to accounts receivable from staff, the Board identified the cause of the overdue accounts as management's failure to enforce the recovery policy, which requires that telephone and liberty mileage charges be deducted at source from the mission subsistence allowance or salary of the staff members concerned.
The Committee is also concerned that accounts receivable remained outstanding in some cases for a period of up to three years.
The Committee notes from paragraph 44 of the Board's report that the Administration has recently implemented procedures in the missions to ensure recovery of accounts receivable from personnel prior to their departure from the missions.
Nevertheless, the Committee is of the view that urgent measures should be taken to significantly reduce both the overdue amounts and the time period for which they remain outstanding.
The Committee requests the Board to follow up on this matter in its next audit.
The Advisory Committee sought clarification in respect of the amount of $11.7 million advanced to a troop-contributing country referred to in paragraph 42 of the Board's report and was informed that the Secretariat had received invoices totalling $7.8 million and was trying to match them against United Nations Operation in Somalia receipt and inspection reports.
The Secretariat has also been informed by the troop-contributing country that the balance of the invoices would be submitted in due course; however, they also advised that this could take up to two years.
The Board has followed up on its previous work and has also responded to requests from the General Assembly for special audits of the management of peacekeeping liquidation and asset disposal activities, including the write-off of non-expendable property.
The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the value of peacekeeping inventory was $392.5 million as at 30 June 1999.
The Committee is of the view that little appreciable progress has been made to improve the efficiency of inventory management in the United Nations peacekeeping operations.
This view was later confirmed by the Office of Internal Oversight Services, which concluded that recent audits had found that excessive expendable inventories at the time of mission liquidation was a recurring problem that needed to be addressed by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (A/54/394, para.
27). In paragraphs 110 to 167 of its report, the Board identified a number of serious weaknesses related in particular to the proper receipt, recording and effective control of assets in mission operations.
The Board also noted instances of the lack of essential records for the purpose of conducting the audit.
The Advisory Committee is not satisfied with the action the Administration has taken so far concerning the audit finding in paragraph 124 of the Board's report regarding the loss of laptop computers in the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala.
In view of the Board's conclusion in paragraph 125 of the report, the Committee requests that the circumstances leading to the loss of the laptops be fully investigated.
The Advisory Committee welcomes the progress made so far with regard to procurement for peacekeeping operations and notes that planning and the use of systems contracts for the procurement of a number of bulk items has led to savings.
The Committee exchanged views with the auditors and with representatives of the Secretary-General on the recommendations contained in paragraphs 57 and 155 of the audit report.
On the basis of those exchanges, the Committee is of the opinion that the cost-effectiveness of standardization should be carefully analysed for those items such as communication and data-processing assets.
The audit has nevertheless pointed out a number of weaknesses in the procurement process that need to be addressed.
For example, the receiving, inspecting and reporting processes need considerable improvement.
The Committee is of the view that purchase contracts should include certain clauses that could protect the United Nations in situations where the terms of purchase contracts are not completely fulfilled by a vendor.
Another serious weakness identified by the Board is that missions transfer obsolete assets among each other or send them to the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy; this practice could have considerable financial implications if corrective measures are not taken in due course.
The Board's recommendation to this effect is contained in paragraph 162 of its report.
The Advisory Committee welcomes the fact that a substantial proportion of peacekeeping procurement is now done in the field, as reported in paragraph 59 of the audit report.
The Committee was provided, upon request, with a chart indicating the workflow of the procurement process for peacekeeping operations (see annex).
In view of the considerable decentralization in peacekeeping procurement and the fourfold increase in delegated authority, from $50,000 to $200,000, the Advisory Committee believes that Headquarters should have an effective and efficient mechanism for monitoring procurement in the field.
Meanwhile, the workload and functions of the Procurement Division, the Field Administration and Logistics Division and the relevant units of the Department of Management in the procurement process should be assessed to ensure that each is planning and performing with optimum efficiency.
The use of new technology should facilitate such monitoring by Headquarters in a manner that would avoid excessive bureaucracy and paperwork.
The Committee stresses also the importance of training in procurement for peacekeeping operations, especially in newly established missions.
The Advisory Committee notes that the Procurement Manual has been issued in one language only (English).
The Committee recommends that consideration be given to issuing the Manual in other official languages of the United Nations.
The Advisory Committee points out that one factor that would facilitate improvement in the management of field assets is the full implementation and use of the field assets control system, which has been under implementation since 1998.
The Committee requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly a comprehensive report on the use of the field assets control system and the extent to which it has benefited procurement and the management of peacekeeping assets; this should be done in the context of peacekeeping budgets for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002.
The report should address the full implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors, the Advisory Committee and the Office of Internal Oversight Services (in document A/53/394) on procurement and the management of peacekeeping assets.
The Committee further recommends that the report address the issue of adequacy of resources devoted to peacekeeping asset management and to liquidation activities.
In this connection, the Committee reiterates its views on the issue of selecting police monitors (see A/53/895, para.
19). In view of the increasing use of police monitors in peacekeeping operations, Headquarters should urgently review the current selection and clearance process with a view to making it more efficient and less costly.
The Committee reiterates its view that countries that provide civilian police to United Nations missions should be responsible for the cost of repatriating those police monitors who do not meet United Nations standards.
The Committee is also of the view that those standards should be set in such a way as to meet the specific operational needs of each particular mission.
The Advisory Committee supports the view of the Board of Auditors expressed in paragraph 71 of its report on the issue of procurement under exigency.
The Committee points out in this connection that it has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the definition of exigency needs (A/54/650) and recommends acceptance of the new definition.
Furthermore, the Committee reiterates its view that the application of exceptions to bidding on the basis of exigency should not preclude the submission of such cases to the Committee on Contracts.
Paragraphs 175 to 179 of the Board's report deal with cases of fraud and presumptive fraud.
The Advisory Committee notes that details of the fraud case in the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina are contained in a report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (A/54/683).
The Committee notes with concern that this fraud went on for a period of over two years, even though there was a resident auditor in the Mission who first confirmed the irregularities in October 1998.
The Committee also notes with concern that some missions (the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia and the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force) had not responded to the Administration's request to provide details of cases of fraud or presumptive fraud during the period ending 30 June 1999.

Financing of the United Nations Mission in East Timor
Financing of the United Nations Mission in East Timor
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General of 1 March 2000 on the financing of the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) (A/54/775).
The document contains the performance report of UNAMET for the period from 5 May to 30 November 1999, as well as a request for an additional appropriation for that period in the amount of $26,913,800 gross ($26,499,800 net) and an assessment in the amount of $23,241,600 gross ($22,827,600 net).
During its consideration of this matter, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information.
The Advisory Committee was informed that the revised estimates called for in General Assembly resolution 54/20 of 29 October 1999, and referred to in paragraph 17 of the report of the Secretary-General of 21 September 1999 (A/54/380), were not issued, in view of the developments that took place leading to the establishment of the International Force in East Timor (INTERFET) and the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).
In its resolution 54/20, the General Assembly approved a revised appropriation totalling $54,428,400 gross ($52,941,100 net) for UNAMET for the period from 5 May to 30 September 1999, inclusive of budgeted voluntary contributions in kind valued at $3,438,700.
By the same resolution, the Assembly authorized the Secretary-General to enter into commitments up to $28,037,100 gross ($27,080,700 net), inclusive of budgeted voluntary contributions in kind valued at $2,752,200 and the commitment authority up to $10 million granted by the Advisory Committee to the Secretary-General on 9 September 1999, for the requirements of UNAMET for the period from 1 September to 30 November 1999, pending the submission of a revised budget by the Secretary-General.
Thus, in its resolution 54/20, the General Assembly approved for the operation of the Mission a total financial provision amounting to $92,465,500 gross ($90,021,800 net) for the period from 5 May to 30 November 1999, inclusive of budgeted voluntary contributions in kind totalling $6,190,900.
In addition, as indicated in paragraph 1 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/54/775), in its resolution 54/20 the General Assembly decided to apportion the amount of $7,155,000 gross ($5,667,700 net) among Member States, taking into account the voluntary contributions to the Trust Fund for the Settlement of the Question of East Timor in the amount of $43,834,700 and in-kind contributions valued at $3,438,700 for the same period.
The Advisory Committee notes, from paragraph 9 of the report, that the Secretary-General proposes an additional assessment in the amount of $23,241,600 gross ($22,827,600 net), taking into account in-kind contributions valued at $3,672,200.
The voluntary contributions in kind reflect an additional voluntary contribution value of $920,000, as compared to budgeted voluntary contributions in kind valued at $2,752,200, for the period from 1 September to 30 November 1999.
As indicated in annex I to the report of the Secretary-General (A/54/775), cumulative expenditures for the Mission amounted to $81,342,200 gross ($79,440,900 net) for the period from 5 May to 30 November 1999, resulting in an unencumbered balance of $11,123,300 gross ($10,580,900 net), as compared to the total financial provision approved by the General Assembly in resolution 54/20.
The large unencumbered balance resulted from under-implementation of mission activities caused by the political disturbances that followed the popular consultation.
As indicated in annex II of the report, these included, mainly, underexpenditure in military personnel costs ($1,010,700) resulting largely from under-deployment of military liaison officers and the non-deployment of a level II field hospital; unspent balances in civilian police costs ($2,504,700) resulting from delays in deployment of civilian police in the mission area; savings in international and local staff costs ($4,493,100) resulting from under-deployment of international staff, lower expenditure on consultant services and lower than expected official travel; and underexpenditure in operational costs ($2,641,800) and other programmes ($849,900).
The Committee was informed that total unliquidated obligations amount to $35.3 million, including $21.7 million under operational activities, $10.0 million under civilian personnel, $2.1 million under other programmes and $1.5 for military personnel.
The Advisory Committee was informed that the Secretariat has not planned for a formal liquidation of the Mission.
The Committee was provided with a detailed list of assets lost during the political disturbances in East Timor, with an estimated value of $4.1 million.
The Committee understands that all remaining UNAMET assets have been transferred to UNTAET, but detailed information on what assets were transferred was not provided to the Committee.
The Committee was informed that currently the Field Assets Control System is installed in UNAMET but is not configured to identify information on assets transferred to UNTAET.
The Committee recommends that the General Assembly approve an additional appropriation in the amount of $26,913,800 gross ($26,499,800 net) and assessment in the amount of $23,241,600 gross ($22,827,600 net) for the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET).

Financing of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
Report of the Secretary-General
Contents
On 6 August 1999, the Security Council, in its resolution 1258 (1999), authorized the deployment to the Congo region of up to 90 United Nations military personnel, together with the necessary civilian, political, humanitarian and administrative staff.
By its resolution 1273 (1999) of 5 November 1999, the Council extended the mandate of the military liaison personnel deployed under its resolution 1258 (1999) until 15 January 2000.
Subsequently, in its resolution 1279 (1999) of 30 November 1999, the Security Council, inter alia, decided that the personnel authorized under its resolutions 1258 (1999) and 1273 (1999), including a multidisciplinary staff of personnel in the fields of human rights, humanitarian affairs, public information, medical support, child protection, political affairs and administrative support, which would assist the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, should constitute the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) until 1 March 2000.
In paragraph 9 of that resolution, the Council requested the Secretary-General, with immediate effect, to take the administrative steps necessary for equipping up to 500 United Nations military observers with a view to facilitating future rapid United Nations deployments as authorized by the Council.
On 24 February 2000, the Security Council, by its resolution 1291 (2000), extended the mandate of MONUC until 31 August 2000, and authorized its expansion to consist of up to 5,537 military personnel, including up to 500 observers or more, provided that the Secretary-General determines that there is a need and that it can be accommodated within the overall force size and structure, and appropriate civilian support staff in the areas of human rights, humanitarian affairs, public information, child protection, political affairs, medical support and administrative support, among others, and requested the Secretary-General to recommend immediately any additional force requirements that might become necessary to enhance force protection.
The mandate of MONUC is contained in paragraph 7 of Security Council resolution 1291 (2000), and includes monitoring the implementation of the Ceasefire Agreement (S/1999/815, annex) and investigating violations of the ceasefire; establishing and maintaining continuous liaison with the field headquarters of all the parties' military forces and supervising and verifying their disengagement and redeployment; facilitating humanitarian assistance; cooperating closely with the Facilitator of the national dialogue and providing support and technical assistance to him; and deploying mine action experts, coordinating the initiation of mine action activities, developing mine action plans and carrying out emergency mine action activities in support of its mandate.
The Council also decided, in paragraph 5 of the same resolution, that the phased deployment of MONUC personnel would be carried out as and if the Secretary-General determines that the Mission's personnel would be able to deploy to their assigned locations and carry out their functions as described in its mandate in conditions of adequate security and with the cooperation of the parties, and that he has received firm and credible assurances from the parties to the Ceasefire Agreement to that effect.
Preliminary financial requirements of the Mission
Pursuant to Security Council resolutions 1258 (1999) and 1273 (1999), the Controller has obtained the concurrence of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions to enter into commitments in the amount of $8.7 million gross in order to meet the immediate operational requirements for the preliminary deployment of military and civilian personnel to the Congo region.
Subsequently, pursuant to Security Council resolution 1279 (1999), the Advisory Committee, in response to a request contained in the Controller's letter dated 16 December 1999 addressed to its Chairman, concurred in entering into further commitments for the establishment of MONUC in the amount of $32.3 million gross.
As requested in resolution 1279 (1999), the commitment authority also provided for the acquisition of equipment for the additional military observers and civilian support personnel to be deployed subject to a further decision of the Council (see para.
The total commitment authority granted by the Advisory Committee for the preliminary deployment of the United Nations in the Congo region and for MONUC amounted to $41.0 million gross, and were provided under the terms of section IV of General Assembly resolution 49/233 A. Against this commitment authority of $41.0 million, as at 29 February 2000 expenditures and obligations totalled $33.3 million, including $29.9 million for the acquisition of equipment and matériel and $3.4 million for military and civilian personnel costs.
At the end of March 2000, the strength of the MONUC military component reached 103 personnel, supported by 97 civilian staff.
In paragraphs 60 to 72 of his report to the Security Council on MONUC (S/2000/30), the Secretary-General set out assumptions, the concept of operations and requirements for the deployment of the Mission, including its military force comprising 4 reinforced protected infantry battalion groups accompanied by 500 military observers, 2 marine companies and the supporting military personnel and equipment, as well as civilian personnel.
In his report to the Security Council on the preliminary deployment in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (S/1999/790), the Secretary-General stated that in order to be effective, any United Nations peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, whatever its mandate, would have to be large and expensive.
While the full resource requirements of MONUC are yet to be determined and its full deployment is subject to political, military and logistical constraints, the formidable tasks envisioned for the United Nations under the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement require adequate preparations and subsequent financial support.
In this connection, it is imperative that the necessary resources be provided so that immediate steps can be taken to establish the support infrastructure for the Mission, to acquire the necessary additional equipment and supplies and to enter into the necessary contractual arrangements in anticipation of the early phased deployment in the country of the authorized strength of the Mission's military component, together with additional civilian staff.
It is tentatively estimated that an amount of $200 million, which is inclusive of the $41.0 million commitment authority granted previously by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, will be needed for requirements under accommodation ($42 million), transport operations ($50 million), communications ($40 million), air operations ($15 million), equipment ($27 million) and personnel ($26 million).
While it is clear that expenditures will have to be incurred, a more precise determination cannot be made at this time.
Accordingly, the Secretary-General is seeking commitment authority and assessment of $200 million for MONUC at this time, inclusive of $41.0 million previously authorized by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.
Action to be taken by the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session
Pursuant to the provisions of section IV, paragraph 2, of General Assembly resolution 49/233 A, the Assembly is requested to grant the Secretary-General authority to enter into commitments with assessment in an amount not exceeding $200 million, inclusive of the amount of $41.0 million gross already authorized by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.

Question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)
In accordance with instructions received from my Government, I have the honour to refer to the letter dated 4 January 2000 from the Chargé d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Argentina to the United Nations addressed to you communicating the text of a press communiqué issued on 3 January 2000 by the Government of the Argentine Republic on the question of the Falkland Islands (A/54/701).
The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has no doubt about the sovereignty of the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and rejects as unfounded the claim by the Government of the Argentine Republic to sovereignty over those islands and the surrounding maritime areas and that the Falkland Islands are under illegal occupation by the United Kingdom.
I should be grateful if you would arrange for the text of the present note to be circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 52.

Financing of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission and the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola
Financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola
Report of the Secretary-General
Contents
The present report contains the revised liquidation budget for the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000, which amounts to $15,049,440 gross ($14,306,540 net), as well as the projected requirements for the continuation of liquidation activities thereafter at United Nations Headquarters, estimated at $143,500 gross ($130,500 net).
It should be read in conjunction with the original liquidation budget of the Observer Mission for the same period contained in document A/53/937 dated 5 May 1999, which contains, inter alia, information on political developments in the mission area, operational requirements, voluntary contributions, troop contributions, information on contingent-owned equipment and self-sustainment arrangements and mission-specific costs and ratios.
Accordingly, the present report provides information only on parameters which have changed since the original budget submission.
Based on the recommendation contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions dated 13 May 1999 (A/53/957), the General Assembly, in its resolution 53/228 of 8 June 1999, appropriated an amount of $7,441,540 gross ($7,083,840 net) for the liquidation of MONUA, inclusive of an amount of $369,153 for the support account for peacekeeping operations and $72,387 for the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi.
Subsequently, owing to the developments on the ground described in section II below, the Advisory Committee, in a letter from its Chairman dated 10 December 1999, concurred with the Controller's request to enter into commitments for the continuation of liquidation activities of the Observer Mission in an amount not exceeding $5,274,800 gross ($4,875,100 net), in addition to the appropriation provided in General Assembly resolution 53/228.
The revised liquidation budget for MONUA for the 1999/00 financial period represents an increase of 51 per cent in gross terms ($7,607,900), compared with the original budget for the same period, and reflects the absorption of the commitment authority of $5,274,800 gross ($4,875,100 net) granted by the Advisory Committee (see para.
3 above). Table 1 Financial resources (Thousands of United States dollars)
a Information o the distribution of resources by standard and mission-specific costs is contained in annex II.B.
b Based on appropriation provided in General Assembly resolution 53/228.
Operational plan and requirements
The 1999/00 budget of MONUA contained in the report of the Secretary-General dated 5 May 1999 (A/53/937) was predicated on the early completion of consultations with the Government of Angola regarding the follow-up configuration of the United Nations presence in the country upon expiration of its mandate on 26 February 1999, and on the termination of liquidation activities in the mission area by 31 October 1999, in accordance with the projections indicated in paragraph 33 of the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council dated 24 February 1999 (S/1999/202).
Developments on the ground during the period from July to October 1999, however, had resulted in substantial unforeseen adjustments to the original budget assumptions.
Pending the conclusion of consultations with the Government of Angola, and until the subsequent establishment by the Security Council in its resolution 1268 (1999) of 15 October 1999 of the United Nations Office in Angola, the substantive MONUA personnel required to maintain liaison with the political, military, police and other civilian authorities of Angola, as well as its human rights component, were retained in the country as part of the Observer Mission's staffing establishment.
Moreover, the Mission was obliged to enter into and continue protracted negotiations with the Government of Angola regarding disposition of the substantial amount of assets valued at $38.1 million remaining in the country after the transfer of equipment to other peacekeeping operations and United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi. For that reason, the necessary administrative and technical personnel, military security detachment and logistical support services were also required to continue beyond the originally projected deadlines, resulting in unforeseen additional resource requirements.
As a result, the resources appropriated by the General Assembly in its resolution 53/228 for the liquidation of MONUA have proved to be insufficient.
Status of reimbursement to troop-contributing Governments
Full reimbursement in accordance with the standard rates established by the General Assembly for troop costs has been made to troop contributors up to 31 August 1999.
An estimated amount of $163,800 is due for troop costs for the period from 1 September 1999 to 31 March 2000.
Revised staffing requirements
The proposed staffing establishment shown below reflects the revised requirements of MONUA for the 1999/00 financial period in connection with the continuation of the liquidation activities until 30 June 2000 in situ and for eight work-months at United Nations Headquarters thereafter.
V. Action to be taken by the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session
The actions to be taken by the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session in connection with the financing of MONUA are the following:
(a) To appropriate and assess the additional amount of $7,607,900 gross ($7,222,700 net), for the Mission for the 12-month period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000, inclusive of the commitment authority of $5,274,800 gross ($4,875,100 net) granted by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;
C. Supplementary information
Military personnel costs
Apportionment: $1,391,400; revised estimate: $1,624,500; variance: $233,100
The net increase of $233,100 under this heading is attributable to additional requirements under military observers ($16,100) and military contingents ($225,500) budget line items, partially offset by reduced requirements under other costs pertaining to military personnel ($8,500), owing to the downward revision of the estimated amount owed to troop contributors for major equipment provided to MONUA during the period from 1 July 1999 to 31 October 1999.
Military observers
The increase of $16,100 under the above heading is attributable to the settlement of belated government claims for travel and accompanied excess baggage costs incurred in prior financial periods.
Military contingents
The net increase of $225,500 under this heading is attributable to the retention in the mission area beyond the originally envisaged deadline of 31 August 1999 of an infantry security detachment and a medical support unit, resulting in additional requirements for troop reimbursement costs ($485,300), welfare ($6,900), daily allowance ($8,500), mission subsistence allowance ($109,600) and clothing and equipment allowance ($32,900), partially offset by reduced requirements for the repatriation of troops ($238,000) and rations ($179,700), the cost of which had been absorbed in the 1998/99 financial period.
The revised deployment schedule of military personnel is shown below:
a Represents one staff officer who will remain in the mission area until 31 March 2000 to assist in the investigation of MONUA aircraft crashes.
Other costs pertaining to military personnel
The net decrease of $8,500 under this heading is owing to the downward revision of requirements under contingent-owned equipment ($45,000) as reflected in the memorandum of understanding concluded with troop contributors for the period from 1 July 1999 to 31 October 1999, partially offset by increased requirements under self-sustainment ($36,500), which is primarily attributable to the retention of a military medical unit in the mission area until the end of October 1999.
Apportionment: $2,522,200; revised estimate: $6,365,700; variance: $3,843,500
The increase of $3,843,500 is attributable to additional requirements under civilian police costs ($61,900) international and local staff ($3,630,400) and United Nations Volunteers ($151,200).
The increase of $61,900 under this heading is attributable to (a) retention of one police officer in the mission area until October 1999 ($15,400) and (b) settlement of belated government claims for travel and accompanied excess baggage costs incurred in prior financial periods ($46,500).
International and local staff
The approved budget provided for the repatriation of international civilian personnel and for the phasing out of local staff and covered salaries and related costs for 229 and 122 work-months, respectively.
An increase of $3,630,400 under the above heading is attributable to the delay in the liquidation of the Mission and the consequential retention of international and local staff for the additional 195 and 150 work-months, respectively, beyond the originally envisaged repatriation deadlines, as well as the revision in the local salary scale effective 1 October 1999; hence, the additional requirements under international ($1,674,600) and local staff ($275,300) salaries and common staff costs ($1,054,800), mission subsistence allowance ($600,600) and official travel ($22,500).
Revised provisions under international salaries and common staff costs reflect estimated requirements to cover unutilized annual leave and leave commutation entitlements.
In addition, a provision of $318,800 is made under common staff costs for compensation payments to beneficiaries of the victims of the MONUA aircraft crashes.
With regard to the 2000/01 financial period, the revised cost estimate provides for eight work-months of international staff for the completion of liquidation tasks at United Nations Headquarters.
Liquidation activities at Headquarters would be headed by the Mission's Chief Administrative Officer, assisted by the Chief Finance Officer and two finance assistants (General Service, Other level).
United Nations Volunteers
The increase of $151,200 under this heading is attributable to the retention in the mission area of the United Nations Volunteers (contract management and communications specialists) for the additional 36 work-months.
Based on prior experience in liquidating other missions, the assistance of United Nations Volunteers, in particular, contract management specialists, is essential in processing disputed claims and outstanding invoices, and closing out contracts managed by the Mission.
Operational costs
Apportionment: $2,728,700; revised estimate: $5,874,800; variance: $3,146,100
The net increase of $3,146,100 is attributable to additional requirements under premises/accommodation ($283,400), transport operations ($66,500), communications ($118,200) and supplies and services ($3,252,700), partially offset by reduced requirements under air operations ($473,700) and transport of contingent-owned equipment ($101,000).
Premises/accommodation
The increase of $283,400 under this heading is attributable to the need to retain rented accommodation owing to the delays in the Mission's liquidation, as well as to provide for the refurbishment of rented premises prior to their return to the lessors; hence, the additional requirements under rental of premises ($20,400) and alteration and renovation of premises ($20,000).
With regard to utilities, additional requirements of $243,000 are primarily attributable to the late receipt of invoices from the local contractor.
Transport operations
The increase of $66,500 is attributable to the need to retain vehicles, owing to delays in the Mission's liquidation and reflects the additional requirements under petrol, oil and lubricants ($15,700) and vehicle insurance ($58,000), offset by reduced requirements under spare parts, repairs and maintenance ($7,200).
Air operations
The approved budget provided for the deployment of one B-727 fixed-wing aircraft for the period from 1 July to 31 August 1999, for a total of 280 flight hours.
While services of the aircraft were required during the period from 1 July to 31 December 1999, the actual number of flight hours amounted to 147, resulting in reduced requirements of $473,700 under this heading.
The increase of $118,200 covers the additional cost of commercial communications and is attributable to the extension of the Mission's liquidation in situ until 30 June 2000.
Supplies and services
The increase of $3,252,700 under this heading is primarily attributable to the extension of the logistical support service contract, owing to delays in the disposition of the Mission's assets ($2,037,400), as well as for security services ($257,500) required after the departure in August and November 1999 of its military security detachments, and additional requirements for services related to the examination of crash sites and recovery of the two United Nations-chartered aircraft shot down in the central highlands in December 1998 and January 1999 ($750,700 for the rental and transportation from South Africa of a heavy-lift self-propelled crane and a hydraulic backhoe).
Additional provision is also made under external audit ($20,000), medical treatment and services ($21,800), claims and adjustments ($162,300), sanitation and cleaning materials ($10,000), which is offset by reduced requirements under stationery and office supplies ($1,000) and quartermaster and general stores ($6,000).
Air and surface freight
The decrease of $101,000 under the above heading is attributable to the actual cost of transportation of contingent-owned equipment being lower than the budgeted estimates.
Staff assessment
Original estimate: $357,700; revised estimate: $742,900; variance: $385,200
The increase of $385,200 under this heading is attributable to the retention in the Mission area of the international and local staff.
Income from staff assessment
This amount is derived from staff assessment (see para.
18 [1] above[Author:DU][2] ).

Financing of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) (A/54/808).
In his report, the Secretary-General is seeking authority to enter into commitments, with assessment, in an amount not exceeding $200 million to meet the most immediate anticipated requirements of MONUC.
This amount is inclusive of the amounts of $8.7 million and $32.3 million gross already authorized by the Advisory Committee in November and December 1999, respectively, under the terms of section IV of General Assembly resolution 49/233 A of 23 December 1994 on the administrative and budgetary aspects of peacekeeping operations.
The mandate of MONUC is contained in paragraph 7 of Security Council resolution 1291 (2000) of 24 February 2000.
In paragraphs 3 and 4 of the resolution, the Security Council decided to extend the mandate of MONUC until 31 August 2000 and authorized the expansion of the Mission to consist of up to 5,537 military personnel, including up to 500 observers, or more, provided that the Secretary-General determined that there was a need and that it could be accommodated within the overall force size and structure.
Also in paragraph 4 the Security Council authorized the inclusion of appropriated civilian support staff in the areas, inter alia, of human rights, humanitarian affairs, public information, child protection, political affairs, medical support and administrative support and requested the Secretary-General to recommend immediately any force requirements that might become necessary to enhance force protection.
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 8 of the report of the Secretary-General that against the commitment authorities of $41 million mentioned above, as at 29 February 2000, expenditures and obligations total $33.3 million, including $29.9 million for the requisition of equipment and material and $3.4 million for military and civilian personnel costs.
At the end of March 2000, the strength of the military component of MONUC reached 103 personnel, supported by 97 civilian staff, including 57 local posts.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that no national Professional staff were included in the local staff.
The Advisory Committee notes the amounts indicated in paragraph 11 of the report as tentative estimates of various logistical, equipment and personnel requirements of MONUC.
In this connection, the Committee recommends that efforts be made to use locally available expertise as much as possible and encourages the Secretariat to use fully their past experience in various peacekeeping operations in Africa to obtain goods and services, including local contractors, from local and regional markets.
In response to its request, the Advisory Committee was informed that under the assumptions set out in the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council of 17 January 2000 (S/2000/30), the proposed amount of $200 million would cover the operational requirements of MONUC until the end of the first quarter of the next financial period of the Mission.
A detailed budget proposal for the Mission's requirements will be submitted to the Committee in September 2000 during its fall session.
With respect to the action to be taken by the General Assembly, under the circumstances, the Advisory Committee concurs with the proposal of the Secretary-General in paragraph 13 of his report of 23 March 2000 (A/54/808).
Accordingly, the Committee recommends, that to cover the initial operational requirements of MONUC, the General Assembly authorize the Secretary-General to enter into commitments, with assessment, in an amount not exceeding $200 million, inclusive of the amount of $41 million gross already authorized by the Advisory Committee.
In making this recommendation, the Committee is aware of the many uncertainties with regard to MONUC, including the timing of deployment.
In this connection, the Committee recalls paragraph 5 of Security Council resolution 1291 (2000).
The Committee is also concerned about the problems inherent in stockpiling in advance in such situation.
The Committee looks forward to receiving the report of the Secretary-General, by which time the situation should have been clarified.

The situation of democracy and human rights in Haiti
Proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001
Letter dated 31 March 2000 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the General Assembly
The International Civilian Support Mission in Haiti (MICAH) was launched on 16 March 2000 in accordance with the decision of the General Assembly last December.
This decision was in keeping with the expressed wishes of Member States to continue to assist the Haitian people in their goal of attaining development and democracy.
I endorsed this approach in my recent report to the Security Council on the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (S/2000/150 of 25 February 2000).
As you are aware, it was decided that MICAH would be funded both from the regular budget ($9.2 million) and from voluntary contributions ($14.7 million).
Regular budgetary resources cover MICAH core staff as well as administrative personnel.
However, substantive positions in the three pillars — justice, human rights and police — were to be covered by voluntary contributions.
A Canadian donation of some $600,000 is anticipated shortly.
In addition, the United States of America has contributed $1.9 million earmarked for helicopter service.
The General Assembly requested me to report should the extrabudgetary resources for the Mission become insufficient.
I wish to report that to date, no contribution has been received for the MICAH Trust Fund.
As a result, MICAH began its mandate on 16 March 2000 with only core staff in the mission area.
Without substantive staff, the mandate entrusted by the General Assembly cannot be fulfilled.
In the light of the lack of financial resources for MICAH, the Assembly may wish to consider whether, instead of preserving a presence in Haiti which has only core staff and is unable to carry out the envisaged activities in the areas of justice, human rights and police, the Mission be closed and its substantive activities be transferred to the United Nations Development Programme.
More generally, I should like to note the increasing tendency of late for the Organization to be given mandates without the necessary financial resources also being provided.
I should be grateful if you would bring this letter to the attention of the members of the General Assembly.

Agenda item 141
Financing of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan
Financing of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General contained in document A/54/705 on the financial performance of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999.
During its consideration of the report, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information and clarification.
In his report to the Security Council of 4 November 1999 (S/1999/1127), the Secretary-General states that “as transition period nears its end, UNMOT approaches the completion of its assignment” (para.
32); moreover, the Secretary-General recommended the extension of the mandate of UNMOT until 15 May 2000, which was envisaged as the last extension of the mandate, and indicated also that the future political role for the United Nations in Tajikistan would be outlined in his interim report to be submitted to the Security Council before the end of the mandate of UNMOT (para.
34). The Council, in its resolution 1274 (1999) of 12 November 1999, agreed with the proposals of the Secretary-General.
As indicated in the performance report, expenditures for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 amount to $16,360,600 gross, resulting in an unencumbered balance of $3,639,400 gross.
According to the Secretary-General, the unencumbered balance resulted mainly from the low level of deployment of both military and civilian personnel owing to the security situation and the delayed establishment of the Joint Security Unit.
The Advisory Committee points out that the amount of the unencumbered balance for the financial period ended 30 June 1999 could have been considerably higher if the security situation in the mission area had been more favourable.
The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that expenditures incurred as a result of the security situation in the mission area amounted to a total of $2,551,850 and included the following:
(a) Purchase of 18 armoured scout vehicles ($1,974,300);
(b) Purchase of communications equipment to provide at least passive protection ($386,200);
(c) Security services in the form of armed guards to protect the Mission's containerized camp and additional storage space in Dinamo stadium ($22,000);
(d) Security guards/watchmen for the team sites ($4,000);
(e) Services of a security company in Almaty for securing the Mission's cash transactions ($3,600);
(f) Security guards for the residence of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General ($3,400);
(g) Difference between the mission subsistence allowance for Dushanbe and the daily subsistence allowance for Tashkent, in connection with the temporary relocation of military observers ($122,650);
(h) Difference between the mission subsistence allowance for Dushanbe and the daily subsistence allowance for Tashkent, in connection with the temporary relocation of international civilian staff ($35,700).
The Advisory Committee requests that detailed information on security related expenditures be included in the supplementary information provided to the Committee before its consideration of budget performance reports on all peacekeeping operations concerned.
As can be seen from table 1 of the report, the unencumbered balance of $3,639,400 (gross) reflects the fact that savings of $896,900 under “Military personnel”, $3,196,400 under “Civilian personnel”, $979,600 under “Other programmes” and $426,430 under “Staff assessment” were partially offset by an over-expenditure of $1,793,300 under “Operational requirements” and an expenditure of $66,500 representing the prorated share of UNMOT of the cost of maintaining the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy.
Annex II to the report contains supplementary information on the variances; the Committee notes from paragraphs 4, 8 and 9 therein that over-expenditures under operational requirements resulted primarily from the acquisition of 18 armoured scout vehicles, the unforeseen replacement of obsolete and damaged office furniture and equipment, upgrading of electronic data-processing systems to ensure year 2000 compliance and from the additional requirements under supplies and services.
With regard to the acquisition of the armoured vehicles, it is recalled that the Controller had initially sought the concurrence of the Advisory Committee to enter into commitments in an amount not exceeding $4.1 million primarily for the acquisition of 28 such vehicles.
The Committee agreed that the purchase was necessary, but expressed its view that no additional commitment authority would be required in view of the pattern of expenditures of UNMOT.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the fact that only 18 armoured vehicles had been purchased reflected that not as many personnel had been deployed in the mission area as originally envisaged.
The reported over-expenditure of $361,800 under “Other equipment” consists of $230,000 for unbudgeted replacement of electronic data-processing equipment to ensure year 2000 compliance, $41,700 for unbudgeted purchase of scanning equipment and high-speed copiers and $40,700 for unbudgeted replacement of worn/damaged furniture.
The Advisory Committee observes with concern that the performance report does not contain information on the circumstances that gave rise to the unforeseen nature of the purchases.
The Committee requests that such circumstances be fully disclosed and justified in performance reports and that replacement of obsolete or damaged equipment should, to the extent possible, be made on the basis of the approved budget.
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 3 of annex II to the report that an over-expenditure of $105,500 resulted from higher requirements for official travel, including that relating to the installation of the field assets control system and the implementation of new identification and electronic archiving systems.
In this connection, the Committee notes with concern that the information on the inventory for the Mission, which was provided to the Committee as supplementary information, is deficient in a number of ways.
For example, no totals for inventory value could be easily obtained from the information; some items had no bar codes, others had no tag numbers and some vehicles had no serial numbers; and there was no information on the date of purchase, only the date on which the item was received in the mission.
The Committee also points out that inventory lists for other missions identify items transferred to missions and items written off although such items are not indicated in the UNMOT inventory.
The Committee notes that the bulk of the inventory of UNMOT had been received during the years 1998 and 1999.
However, without knowing the date of acquisition, it is not possible to determine the residual value of equipment at the time of disposal.
The Committee understands that most of the equipment in the Mission, with the exception of that transferred from other missions and/or United Nations Logistics Base, should be fairly new, since the Mission was established by the Security Council not that long ago (December 1994).
In this connection, the Committee recalls the observation of the Office of Internal Oversight Services that recent audits had found that excessive expendable inventories at the time of mission liquidation was a recurring problem that needed to be addressed by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (A/54/394, para.
27). Accordingly, the Advisory Committee recommends that in the event the Mission is liquidated after 15 May 2000, qualified personnel be retained to manage the disposition of the Mission's assets.
The Committee expects also that a significant part of the Mission's assets should be available either for stock at the United Nations Logistics Base or for use by other peacekeeping operations.
The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the performance report for UNMOT is indicated in paragraph 14 of document A/54/705.
The Advisory Committee recommends that the unencumbered balance of $3,639,400 gross ($3,213,100 net) for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 be credited to Member States in a manner to be decided by the General Assembly.
Fifty-fourth session
Agenda item 145
Financing of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium and the Civilian Police Support Group
Financing of the Civilian Police Support Group
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General of 17 January 2000 on the financial performance of the Civilian Police Support Group, for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 (A/54/713).
During its consideration of the report, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information.
As indicated in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the report of the Secretary-General, by its resolution 1120 (1997) of 14 July 1997, the Security Council terminated the mandate of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES), effective 15 January 1998.
Subsequently, in its resolution 1145 (1997) of 19 December 1997, the Security Council established the Civilian Police Support Group for a single nine-month period ending 15 October 1998.
By the same resolution, the Council decided that the Support Group would assume responsibility for those UNTAES personnel and United Nations owned assets needed for its use in the fulfilment of its mandate.
In its resolution 52/244 of 26 June 1998, the General Assembly appropriated the amount of $7,483,160 gross ($6,994,260 net) for the maintenance of the Support Group for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998, inclusive of $383,160 for the support account for peacekeeping operations.
That amount has been assessed on Member States.
By the same resolution, the Assembly decided to continue to use the Special Account for UNTAES for the Support Group beginning 16 January 1998.
As shown in paragraph 11 and table 1 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/54/713), expenditures for the reporting period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 amounted to $6,606,000 gross ($6,099,300 net), inclusive of $27,000 in unliquidated obligations, resulting in an unencumbered balance of $877,160 gross ($895,000 net), some 12 per cent of the amount appropriated.
Significant variances are shown in annexes I and II of the report, and include underutilized balances of $433,200 under operational requirements.
The expenditure of $61,400 for the prorated share of the Support Group for the cost of maintaining the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi for the reporting period was absorbed within the resources provided.
As indicated in annex II to the report, under civilian personnel, the vacancy rate of 35 per cent for civilian police and the transfer of 60 civilian police to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) largely accounted for the unutilized balance of $759,500 under civilian police costs.
However, under international and local staff costs, additional requirements amounting to $772,800 resulted primarily from the inclusion of expenditures for the continued liquidation of UNTAES ($487,000) and additional requirements in respect of the Support Group ($285,000) for commutation of annual leave and repatriation costs for mission appointees upon termination of their contracts, as well as overtime (see annex II, paras.
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 11 and table 2 of the report that the unencumbered balance was reduced by absorption of expenditures incurred for the extension of the UNTAES liquidation, amounting to $614,000 gross ($535,000 net), including $48,000 in unliquidated obligations.
Thus, as indicated in paragraph 11 and table 3 of the report, the resulting unutilized balance for the period amounted to $263,160 gross ($359,960 net).
With respect to the status of reimbursement to troop-contributing Member States, the Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 30 June 1998, the amount reimbursed for troop costs for UNTAES/Support Group was $101,178,329, and no balance was owed.
As at 31 December 1999, the amount reimbursed for contingent-owned equipment amounted to $45,375,211; the estimated amount owed for contingent-owned equipment was $33,239,479; and unliquidated obligations in respect to contingent-owned equipment were $15,032,026.
In this connection, the Committee was informed, upon enquiry, about the procedure being followed by the Secretariat regarding reimbursement to troop-contributing countries for personnel and equipment provided (see A/54/801, para. 7).
In addition an amount of $26,706,747 for contingent-owned equipment was held in accounts payable.
Under the death and disability compensation line of the budget, as at 31 December 1999, an amount of $337,963 was paid for 15 claims, leaving a balance of $2,975,453 in unliquidated obligations and 5 pending claims.
The Advisory Committee was also informed that the total amount assessed on Member States for UNTAES/Support Group for the period from its inception to 31 December 1999 is $432.2 million, against which the payments received amount to $391.9 million, leaving an outstanding balance of $31.3 million.
As at 31 December 1999, the Mission's cash position stood at $72.7 million.
As indicated in paragraph 5 of the report, by its resolution 53/234 of 8 June 1999, the General Assembly had authorized the Secretary-General to utilize an amount of $601,200 gross ($541,500 net) from the resources provided for the period ending 30 June 1998, in order to meet the cost of completing the liquidation of UNTAES, as well as the final audit of the Mission.
In this connection, the Advisory Committee recommends that the remaining unencumbered balances of $601,200 gross ($541,500 net) for the period ending 30 June 1998, and $263,160 gross ($359,960 net) for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999, should be credited to Member States in a manner to be decided by the General Assembly.
Fifty-fourth session
Agenda item 146
Financing of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force
Financing of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General, containing the financial performance of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 (A/54/740).
During its consideration of the report, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided the Committee with additional information and clarifications.
The Committee points out that the report under consideration is a final performance report for UNPREDEP and a report on the disposition of the mission's assets will be submitted to the General Assembly as soon as possible.
Following the termination of the mandate of the Force on 28 February 1999, the General Assembly, by its resolution 53/29 B of 8 June 1999, reduced the appropriation of $50,053,745 gross provided for the same period by its resolutions 52/245 of 26 June 1998 and 53/20 A of 2 November 1998 to the amount of $43,062,700 gross.
The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the financial situation of UNPREDEP was as follows:
(a) Total unliquidated obligations as at 17 February 2000: $36.7 million;
(b) Amounts in accounts payable as at 17 February 2000: $18.7 million;
(d) Unpaid assessments as at 31 January 2000: $10.9 million.
As indicated in the performance report, expenditures for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 amount to $41,901,000 gross, resulting in an unencumbered balance of $1,161,700 gross.
According to the Secretary-General, the unencumbered balance resulted mainly from lower costs of troop rotation and rapid liquidation of the mission during the period from March to June 1999.
The Committee notes that the expenditure of $41.9 million gross does not include, however, an amount of $904,000 required for reimbursing a Government for the rotation of its troops during the prior period from May 1996 to June 1998.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that, although the related funds for the troop rotation were requested by the Secretary-General in paragraph 3, annex II.C to his report contained in document A/53/437/Add.1, and were subsequently authorized by the General Assembly, the related obligations have never been raised owing to an oversight.
As can be seen from section III, paragraph 9, table 1, of the report of the Secretary-General contained in document A/54/740, the unencumbered balance of $1,161,700 reflects the fact that savings of $934,700 under “military personnel”, $428,400 under “civilian personnel”, $5,900, under “other programmes” and $57,400, under “staff assessment” were partially offset by an over-expenditure of $264,700 under “operational requirements”.
Annex II to the same report contains supplementary information on the variances; the Committee notes from paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 therein, that considerable funds were spent on refurbishment of the mission's equipment.
Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that, pursuant to paragraph 9 of General Assembly resolution 52/1 B of 26 June 1998, requirements of UNPREDEP for the refurbishment of equipment shipped to the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, which had the total residual value of $3,809,150, were estimated at $1,142,745; no provision was made in the mission's budget for the refurbishment.
The Committee requests that future budget documents for peacekeeping operations fully disclose the rationale and methodology for financing the refurbishment at the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi of equipment of those missions which are being liquidated.
The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that resources provided for the liquidation of UNPREDEP are sufficient and that all phases of the liquidation would be completed by 30 June 2000.
Moreover, the Committee was informed that the liquidation team of UNPREDEP composed of two Professional (1 P-5 and 1 P-2) and three General Service staff performed the liquidation activities during the period from 1 July to 15 October 1999; all residual liquidation activities thereafter and until 30 June 2000 will be performed by staff of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations at Headquarters.
The Advisory Committee recalls, in this connection, that the Secretary-General had indicated in his report (A/53/812/Add.1) that the liquidation period of UNPREDEP would last three-and-one-half months, namely, from 1 July to 15 October 1999.
The Advisory Committee points out in this connection that, as of the date of the termination of the mission's mandate on 28 February 1999, the liquidation activities for UNPREDEP will have taken approximately 16 months for a force of 1,050 troops, 35 military observers, 26 civilian police and 203 civilian staff.
The Committee acknowledges that the period of liquidation is not necessarily a function of the size of a mission.
It is also related to adequate planning, resource allocation and to the efficiency with which liquidation activities are carried out.
The Committee points out that as more missions are liquidated, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations takes on more residual liquidation activities.
It is essential, therefore, that the Department review its capacity in this area so that undue delays are not experienced in the final phase of the liquidation of missions.
The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the performance report for UNPREDEP is indicated in section IV, paragraph 11, of the report of the Secretary-General (A/54/740).
The Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly accept the Secretary-General's proposal to retain the amount of $904,000 from the unencumbered balance of a total of $1,161,700 for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 to cover the costs of outstanding claims from a Government for the rotation of its troops during the prior period.
The Committee recommends further that the remaining unencumbered balance of $257,700 gross ($200,300 net) for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 be credited to Member States in a manner to be decided by the General Assembly.

Agenda item 147
Financing of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti, the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti and the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti
Financing of the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financial performance report of the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH) for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 (A/54/757).
During its consideration of the report, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information.
By its resolutions 52/246 of 26 June 1998 and 53/222 A of 7 April 1999, the General Assembly appropriated a total amount of $29,968,700 gross ($28,536,700 net) for the maintenance of MIPONUH for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999, inclusive of $894,085 for the support account for peacekeeping operations.
Expenditures for the same period amounted to $26,261,000 gross ($25,101,100 net), inclusive of $5,854,000 in unliquidated obligations.
The resulting unencumbered balance of $3,707,700 gross ($3,435,600 net), representing approximately 12 per cent of the amount appropriated, was owing to savings under civilian personnel, operational requirements, other programmes and staff assessment, offset partially by overrun under military personnel.
Details on financial performance and supplementary information are presented in annexes I and II to the report of the Secretary-General (A/54/757).
The Committee notes from paragraph 1 of annex II to the report of the Secretary-General that the additional requirement of $180,000 under military personnel for death and disability related to a helicopter accident in March 1999.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that there are guidelines to be followed in the event of accidents.
The Committee was also informed that a review is being carried out by the International Civil Aviation Organization on air operations in peacekeeping operations.
The terms of reference of the review include the mandate of the Transport Services of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, as it relates to the provision of aviation support, all applicable directives associated with air movements, the processes used to convey policy to all relevant staff, responsibilities for the procurement, management and operation of aviation resources and responsibilities for the safety of air operations.
The Committee was informed that the amount of $509,900 was unutilized on local staff salaries mainly because, by error, local staff salaries were budgeted at gross amounts instead of net amounts.
With regard to spare parts, repairs and maintenance of vehicles, the Committee was informed that an overrun of $64,800 had been incurred under this item owing to higher costs of repairing an old fleet of vehicles that were seven to eight years old.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that instead of being automatically replaced, vehicles five years old or with 120,000 miles had been retained because of uncertainty regarding the mandate of the Mission.
The Advisory Committee was informed that an amount of $19,200 was unutilized under commercial communication, owing to the closure of three civilian police stations.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the three stations had been closed in the context of the scaling down of operations following the expiration of the mandates of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti and the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti.
The Committee was also informed that an amount of $16,900 under public information programmes, resulted primarily from the scaling down of activities owing to a shortage of personnel in the public information unit.
As regards reimbursement for the formed unit, the Committee was informed that, as at 31 December 1999, the amount was $2,565,671 for the period from inception up to 30 April 1999, and that the amount owed for the period from 1 May to 31 December 1999 was $1,235,911.
With regard to reimbursement for contingent-owned equipment, the Committee was informed that the amount was $417,346, the estimated amount owed was $646,896 and unliquidated obligations for contingent-owned equipment amounted to $681,477.
In case of death and disability, six claims paid amounted to $300,000 and unliquidated claims amounted to $26,700.
The Committee was informed that, at 31 December 1999, the cash position amounted to $12.3 million.
Assessments amounted to $151.6 million, payments received totalled $127.7 million and amounts outstanding were $23.9 million.
Total unliquidated obligations for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 were $2,626,182, as at 31 December 1999.
The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of MIPONUH is to decide on the treatment of the unencumbered balance of $3,707,700 gross ($3,435,600 net), for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999.
The General Assembly may wish to consider crediting the unencumbered balance to Member States or to the trust fund of the International Civilian Support Mission in Haiti (MICAH).

Report of the Fifth Committee
Rapporteur: Mr. Jan Piotr Jaremczuk (Poland)
I. Introduction
At its 90th plenary meeting, on 2 March 2000, the General Assembly, on the proposal of the Secretary-General (A/54/237), decided to include in the agenda of its fifty-fourth session the item entitled “Financing of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo” and to allocate it to the Fifth Committee.
The Fifth Committee considered the item at its 57th and 58th meetings, on 29 and 31 March 2000.
Statements and observations made in the course of the Committee's consideration of the item are reflected in the relevant summary records (A/C.5/54/SR.57 and 58).
For its consideration of the item, the Committee had before it the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (A/54/808) and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/54/813).
Consideration of draft resolution A/C.5/54/L.53
At the 58th meeting, on 31 March, the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran, on behalf of the Chairman, introduced a draft resolution entitled “Financing of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo” (A/C.5/54/L.53), which he submitted on the basis of informal consultations.
At the same meeting, the Committee adopted draft resolution A/C.5/54/L.53 without a vote (see para.
Recommendation of the Fifth Committee
The Fifth Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the following draft resolution:
Financing of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,
Bearing in mind Security Council resolutions 1258 (1999) of 6 August 1999 and 1279 (1999) of 30 November 1999 regarding the deployment to the Congo region of military liaison personnel and the establishment of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, respectively, and Security Council resolution 1291 (2000) of 24 February 2000, by which the Council extended the mandate of the Mission until 31 August 2000,
Recognizing that the costs of the Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,
Recognizing also that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Mission, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,
Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,
Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,
Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Trust Fund to Support the Peace Process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,
Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursements to troop contributors that bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

Authorizes the Secretary-General to enter into commitments for the Mission for the period from 6 August 1999 to 30 June 2000 in an amount not exceeding 200 million United States dollars gross (199,760,000 dollars net), inclusive of the amount of 41,011,200 dollars gross (40,771,200 dollars net) previously authorized by the Advisory Committee, and requests the Secretary-General to establish a special account for the Mission;
Decides, as an ad hoc arrangement, to apportion the amount of 200 million dollars gross (199,760,000 dollars net) among Member States in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of General Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991, 47/218 A of 23 December 1992, 49/249 A of 20 July 1995, 49/249 B of 14 September 1995, 50/224 of 11 April 1996, 51/218 A to C of 18 December 1996 and 52/230 of 31 March 1998 and its decisions 48/472 A of 23 December 1993, 50/451 B of 23 December 1995 and 54/456 to 54/458 of 23 December 1999, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the years 1999 and 2000, as set out in its resolutions 52/215 A of 22 December 1997 and 54/237 A of 23 December 1999;
Decides also that, in accordance with the provisions of its resolution 973 (X) of 15 December 1955, there shall be set off against the apportionment among Member States, as provided for in paragraph 11 above, their respective share in the Tax Equalization Fund of the estimated staff assessment income of 240,000 dollars approved for the Mission for the period from 6 August 1999 to 30 June 2000;
Emphasizes that no peacekeeping mission shall be financed by borrowing funds from other active peacekeeping missions;
Encourages the Secretary-General to continue to take additional measures to ensure the safety and security of all personnel under the auspices of the United Nations participating in the Mission;

I. Introduction
The previous recommendation made by the Fifth Committee to the General Assembly under agenda item 175 appears in the report of the Committee contained in document A/54/830.
The Fifth Committee resumed its consideration of the item at its 72nd, 73rd and 74th meetings, on 26 and 30 May and 2 June 2000.
Statements and observations made in the course of the Committee's consideration of the item are reflected in the relevant summary records (A/C.5/54/SR.72-74).
For its consideration of the item, the Committee had before it the report of the Secretary-General concerning a preliminary expenditure report of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the period from 6 August 1999 to 30 June 2000 (A/54/872) and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, which was presented orally by the Chairman of the Advisory Committee (see A/C.5/54/SR.72).
Consideration of draft resolution A/C.5/54/L.79
At the 74th meeting, on 2 June, the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran, coordinator of the informal consultations on this item, introduced a draft resolution entitled “Financing of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo” (A/C.5/54/L.79), submitted by the Chairman on the basis of informal consultations.
At the same meeting, the Committee adopted draft resolution A/C.5/54/L.79 without a vote (see para.
Recommendation of the Fifth Committee
The Fifth Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the following draft resolution:
Financing of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the related oral report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,
Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 1291 (2000) of 24 February 2000 concerning the extension of the mandate of the Mission,
Notes that, by 30 June 2000, only 500 United Nations military observers and 100 civilian support staff out of up to 5,537 military personnel, including up to 500 military observers, as indicated by the Secretary-General in his report,1 will have been deployed to the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;
Requests the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures with a view to ensuring the deployment of military personnel and the provision of adequate resources to the Mission without any unnecessary delay;
Decides to reduce the commitment authority provided in its resolution 54/260 of 7 April 2000, totalling 200 million United States dollars gross (199,760,000 dollars net) for the operation of the Mission for the period from 6 August 1999 to 30 June 2000, to the amount of 58,681,000 dollars gross (58,441,000 dollars net);
Decides also to authorize the Secretary-General to enter into commitments for the operation of the Mission for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 in an amount not exceeding 141,319,000 dollars gross (140,827,100 dollars net), which amount represents the difference between the commitment authority provided in its resolution 54/260 for the period from 6 August 1999 to 30 June 2000 and the reduced commitment authority provided in paragraph 3 above;
Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly, in September 2000, a comprehensive report on the financing of the Mission, including full budget estimates and information on the utilization of resources up to the time of the submission of the report, to enable the Assembly to take action on it at the main part of its fifty-fifth session.
Fifty-fourth session
Agenda item 133
Financing of the United Nations Protection Force, the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia, the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force and United Nations Peace Forces headquarters
Financing of the United Nations Protection Force, the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia, the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force and United Nations Peace Forces headquarters
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financial performance of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia, known as UNCRO, the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) and United Nations Peace Forces headquarters (A/54/803).
During its consideration of the report, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information and clarification.
UNPROFOR was established by the Security Council in its resolution 743 (1992) of 21 February 1992.
The mandate of the Force was extended by subsequent Council resolutions and, on 31 March 1995, by its resolutions 981 (1995), 982 (1995) and 983 (1995), the Council decided to establish UNCRO, to extend the mandate of UNPROFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that UNPROFOR in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia would be known as UNPREDEP.
The administrative and logistic responsibilities of all three operations were coordinated at United Nations Peace Forces headquarters in Zagreb.
The United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) and the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) were established by the Council in its resolutions 1035 (1995) of 21 December 1995 and 1037 (1996) of 15 January 1996 respectively.
The mandates of UNPROFOR and UNCRO were terminated at the end of 1995 and the beginning of 1996 respectively.
As indicated in paragraphs 35 to 39 of the report, a total of $5,082,586,459 gross ($5,044,754,959 net) was appropriated by the General Assembly for the United Nations Peace Forces.
Total expenditures as at 31 December 1999 amount to $4,452,507,000 gross ($4,417,943,900 net), leaving a balance of $630,079,459 gross ($626,811,059 net).
Of that balance, $325,900,432 gross ($321,855,689 net) has been credited to Member States, bringing the total balance of appropriations to $304,179,027 gross ($304,955,370 net).
As indicated in paragraph 38 of the report, the current balance of appropriations is due primarily to savings resulting from the cancellation of prior period obligations.
The Advisory Committee was informed that the total amount assessed on Member States for the period from 12 January 1992 to 31 December 1999 as at 29 February 2000 was $4,860,018,052, against which the payments received amounted to $4,236,598,310, leaving an outstanding balance of $623,419,742.
The Advisory Committee was also informed that troop cost reimbursement up to 30 June 1997 totalled $1,343,310,600 and that nothing was owed in that respect.
With regard to contingent-owned equipment, the Committee was informed that as at 31 December 1999 the amount reimbursed was $515,127,600 and the amount owed was $304,245,277.
Unliquidated obligations in respect of contingent-owned equipment as at 31 December 1999 amounted to $165,708,180.
Under death and disability compensation, the Committee was informed that $44,267,400 had been paid as at 31 December 1999 for 563 claims, leaving a balance of $21,700 in unliquidated obligations and 66 pending claims.
The Committee was informed that the cash position of the United Nations Peace Forces as at 13 March 2000 was $35.4 million, with unliquidated obligations for the period from 12 January 1992 to 30 June 1997 totalling $214,284,000.
As indicated in paragraph 39 and annex II.A of the report, funds are required for reimbursement to Governments for claims relating to rotation and repatriation of troops ($5,468,200), reimbursement for contingent-owned equipment ($138,537,100), death and disability compensation ($9,781,500) and various operational requirements ($26,112,900).
Amounts owed to Governments in respect of all claims total $179,899,700.
The Advisory Committee was informed that none of the claims was from commercial vendors, all were claims from Governments and that the amount of $179,899,700 resulted from a number of factors, including underestimation of expenditure for contingent-owned equipment and late submission of claims.
The concurrence of the General Assembly is sought to retain that amount from the total balance of appropriations of $304,179,027 gross ($304,955,370 net). Owing to a high level of unpaid assessments (see para.
4 above), there is a shortage of cash in the United Nations Peace Forces special account.
In view of the cash shortage, the concurrence of the Assembly is also sought to suspend the provisions of financial regulations 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2(d) in respect of the remaining surplus of $124,279,327 gross ($125,055,670 net).
With respect to contingent-owned equipment, the Advisory Committee was informed that the amounts set out in table 7 resulted from negotiations with troop-contributing countries and that all the amounts were firm with the exception of the amount under losses, which remained to be determined definitively by the United Nations Property Survey Board.
The Advisory Committee notes, as indicated in paragraphs 18 to 20 of the report, that expenditures were incurred by the United Nations Peace Forces for a number of items, including rent, airport services, tolls and fuel taxes, that should have been provided free of cost under the terms of agreements signed between the United Nations and the Governments of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia.
The total owed by the four Governments amounts to $127,379,954.
Notes verbales were sent to the respective Permanent Missions to the United Nations on 25 March 1999; however, to date no reimbursement of the expenditures has been received.
Upon enquiry regarding the status of the $127,379,954 in the accounts, the Advisory Committee was informed that the amount represents expenditures that have been recorded in the United Nations Peace Forces accounts, and that should any of the expenditures be reimbursed by the host Governments, that refund of prior period expenditures would be credited to miscellaneous income in accordance with the provisions of financial rule 107.2(a).
The Committee is concerned at the lack of progress in obtaining reimbursement and encourages the Secretary-General to pursue the issue.
The Advisory Committee notes in paragraph 21 of the report of the Secretary-General that voluntary contributions in kind reported by UNPROFOR in April 1994 included vehicles and equipment loaned or donated by one Member State valued at $4,536,820.
However, during negotiations on settlement of claims for contingent-owned equipment, it was determined that those items had been made available on a reimbursable basis.
The Committee also notes in paragraph 25 that goods and services provided by another Member State to the rapid reaction capacity had been valued by the donor at $22,917,009 and by the United Nations at $12,532,826 according to standard United Nations procedures.
Upon enquiry as to whether the valuation by the United Nations had been accepted by that Member State, the Committee was informed that a letter had been sent to the Permanent Mission of the Member State to the United Nations on 20 January 1998 informing it of the value of the contribution by United Nations standards and explaining the basis of the valuation.
There has been no further correspondence from that Member State, and it is therefore believed that the valuation has been accepted.
The Advisory Committee recalls paragraph 26 of the report of the Board of Auditors on the accounts of the United Nations peacekeeping operations for the financial period ended 30 June 1999 (A/54/5, vol. II), in which the Board states that for the period ending 30 June 1999 there were $164 million in unrecorded claims related to UNPF.
The Board noted that the $149 million in certified claims had been included in the notes to the financial statements for the 12-month period ending 30 June 1999 as a contingent liability instead of being disclosed as accounts payable.”
The Committee trusts that this situation will be rectified.
The Committee was informed that the amount of $149 million cited by the Board of Auditors was included in the amount of $179,899,700 being requested for the settlement of all pending government claims.
The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of the United Nations Peace Forces is indicated in paragraph 1 of document A/54/803.
The Advisory Committee recommends retention of the amount of $1,193,000 gross ($963,300 net) from the amount of $1,199,200 gross ($1,070,300 net) concurred in by the Committee from the unencumbered balance of $3,467,200 gross ($4,094,200 net) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 to meet the cost of completing the liquidation of the Mission.
The Committee also recommends retention of the amount of $179,899,700 gross and net from the balance of appropriations of $304,179,027 gross ($304,955,370 net) to meet the cost of outstanding claims.
In respect of the remaining surplus of $124,279,327 gross ($125,055,670 net), the normal course of action would be to credit Member States.
The General Assembly, in considering the options, may wish to consider temporarily suspending the provisions of financial regulations 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2(d) in the light of the chronic cash shortage of the Organization.
Fifty fourth session
Agenda item 128 (a)
Financing of the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces in the Middle East: United Nations Disengagement Observer Force
United Nations Disengagement Observer Force
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the performance report for the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 (A/54/707) and the proposed budget for UNDOF for the 12-month period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 (A/54/732).
During its consideration of these reports, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General and the Chief Administrative Officer of the mission, who provided additional information.
UNDOF was established by the Security Council in its resolution 350 (1974) of 31 May 1974 to supervise the ceasefire called for by the Council and the agreement on disengagement between Israeli and Syrian forces for an initial period of six months.
Its mandate has since then been extended and adjusted by the Council in subsequent resolutions, the latest being resolution 1276 (1999) of 24 November 1999, in which the mandate of the Force was extended until 31 May 2000.
The Advisory Committee was informed that amounts totalling $1,211.9 million had been assessed on Member States for the period from inception until 31 December 1999, and that payments totalled $1,161.5 million, leaving a shortfall of $50.4 million. Moreover, as of 31 January 2000 cash balances amounted to $27.4 million.
The Advisory Committee was also informed that troop-contributing countries had received payments totalling $118,301,440 for the period from 1 December 1989 to 30 April 1999 and that an estimated amount of $9,071,716 was still due for the period from 1 May to 31 December 1999.
Performance report for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999
The performance report (A/54/707) contains information on the financial performance of UNDOF for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999. The report also outlines the action to be taken by the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session in connection with the financing of UNDOF.
Paragraph 7 and table 1 of the performance report indicate that total resources made available to UNDOF for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 amounted to $35,400,100 gross ($34,506,400 net), inclusive of the amount of $1,756,200 for the support account for peacekeeping operations.
Expenditures amounted to $33,662,500 gross ($32,916,100 net), leaving an unencumbered balance of $1,737,600 gross ($1,590,300 net) — approximately 4.9 per cent of the amount appropriated.
The Advisory Committee notes that the savings realized during the reporting period are mostly attributable to civilian vacancies, favourable unit costs obtained for the purchase of vehicles under systems contracts, favourable exchange rates and reduced procurement of equipment and supplies because of the availability of some of those items at the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy.
The Advisory Committee notes that savings totalling $601,700 are reported under civilian personnel costs out of a budgeted provision of $5,553,900.
This was due mostly to the average monthly vacancy rate of 8 per cent for international staff and 4 per cent for local staff for the period, as well as the impact of the depreciation of the local currency on local staff costs.
Savings of $1,390,800 out of a budgeted provision of $4,550,500 are reported under transport operations.
The Advisory Committee notes that an amount of $1,274,000 was saved as a result of the volume discounts obtained from systems contracts for vehicle purchases and the non-purchase of 27 vehicles because of the transfer of some vehicles and spare parts from the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi.
Additional savings are reported under this budget item as a result of favourable exchange rates, which had an impact on workshop equipment, where savings of $10,100 are indicated, on petrol, oil and lubricants ($38,700), and under spare parts, repairs and maintenance ($65,000).
Favourable exchange rates were also responsible for the under-expenditure of $214,000 reported under premises and accommodation, resulting from lower costs under maintenance supplies and services, as well as utilities.
However, the Advisory Committee notes that additional requirements of $143,200 are reported under military personnel costs.
As indicated in paragraph 1 of annex II to the performance report, this was mostly the result of higher local costs during the interim four-month period between the expiry of an old rations contract and the awarding of a new one after competitive bidding.
The Committee sought additional information since, in the case of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), savings, rather than over-expenditures, are reported as a result of the expiry of an old contract and the awarding of a new one.
The Committee was informed that whereas UNIFIL had a larger stock capacity, UNDOF had the capacity to store only one month's reserve of rations.
The Committee trusts that, in future, there will be sufficient planning to allow for the necessary lead-time, thus avoiding excessive costs.
The performance report indicates, in paragraph 9, that the action to be taken by the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session in connection with the financing of UNDOF is a decision on the treatment of the unencumbered balance of $1,737,600 gross ($1,590,300 net) for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999.
The Advisory Committee recommends that Member States be credited their respective shares of the unencumbered balance for the period in question in a manner to be determined by the Assembly.
Proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001
The cost estimates submitted by the Secretary-General in his report on the proposed budget of UNDOF for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 (A/54/732) amount to $34,946,700 gross ($34,195,300 net).
As indicated in paragraph 2 and table 1 of that report, the proposed requirements represent a 5.1 per cent increase in relation to the appropriation of $33,247,500 for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000.
The increase in proposed resources is due to an increase in requirements under salaries and common staff costs for international and local staff, under premises and accommodation and under transport operations, offset by a decrease under communications and other equipment.
A decrease of $35,200 is shown under military personnel costs compared with the 1999/00 appropriation of $18,781,500.
As indicated in paragraph 1 of annex I.C to the proposed budget report, reduced requirements are indicated under mission subsistence allowance as a result of a new door-to-door delivery contract, which has reduced the need for travel by contingent personnel to pick up incoming shipments.
The report indicates, in paragraph 21, that no contingent-owned equipment agreements have been signed with the troop-contributing Governments of UNDOF, with the exception of Japan.
The Advisory Committee was further informed that a memorandum of understanding had been signed providing for reimbursement of seven vehicles on the basis of wet-lease rates.
However, wet-lease rates are applied for budgeting purposes for all the UNDOF contingent-owned equipment.
The Advisory Committee was informed, as in the case of UNIFIL, that aside from the reluctance of the troop contributors to those two missions to convert to the new contingent-owned equipment arrangements, another factor militating against a faster change was that much of the equipment was United Nations-owned.
The replacement of this equipment with new contingent-owned equipment, under the new arrangements, required extensive discussions and negotiations with the troop contributors involved.
The proposed requirements under civilian personnel costs of $5,158,000 reflect an increase of $147,700, or 3 per cent, in relation to the current apportionment.
The staffing requirements of the Force provide for a total of 125 posts (38 international and 87 local), including 2 additional posts (1 P-3 Budget Officer post in Administrative Services and 1 General Service post in the Electronic Data-Processing Section), described in paragraphs 27 and 28 of the budget document.
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
The Advisory Committee further notes that no vacancy rate factor has been applied to the staffing requirements and that part of the increase in requirements under this item results from a 5 per cent increase in local staff salaries effective 1 March 1999, as indicated in paragraphs 3 and 4 of annex I.C to the budget document.
The Committee was further informed that, as at 31 December 1999, of the 36 international and 87 local authorized posts, 28 and 84 were encumbered respectively, resulting in a 23 per cent vacancy rate for international staff and 3.5 per cent for local staff).
The Advisory Committee recalls that in a previous report (A/53/895/Add.1) it referred to the use of mission appointees and the fact that it had been informed there were no staff under the 300 series of staff rules in UNIFIL, UNDOF, the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) or the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, since they were considered established duty stations.
The Committee also indicated that it had been informed, upon enquiry, that there were no operational impediments preventing the hiring of 300-series employees.
The Committee sought additional information in this regard and was informed by a representative of the Office of Human Resources Management of the current practices with regard to the use of limited duration contracts that relate to two pilot schemes (one at the United Nations, another at the United Nations Development Programme) approved by the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) and endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 52/216 of 22 December 1997 (see also para. 25 of the Committee's omnibus report on the financing of peacekeeping operations, A/54/841).
The Committee notes that ICSC is expected to continue its discussions on the issue of appointments of limited duration, based on the experience obtained up to now with both pilot projects, at its summer session this year.
As shown in annex I.A to the budget report, estimated requirements for operational costs increase from $8,722,800 for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 to $10,240,600 for the period under review — a 17.4 per cent increase.
In this connection, the Advisory Committee notes an increase of $30,800 under premises and accommodation from an apportioned amount of $1,492,900 for the current 1999/00 period.
Moreover, paragraph 17 of the budget report indicates that a new priority for the mission is to address the environmental consequences of the Force's activities and presence in the area of operations.
As further indicated in annex I.C (para. 8) and annex II.C, for the first time, a non-recurrent provision of $200,000 is included in the budget for the treatment of human waste and disposal of UNDOF garbage, as well as related training material.
The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that a study was under way to determine the best method of implementing environmental activities.
The Committee's views and recommendations regarding the current case-by-case inclusion of resources for environmental activities are contained in paragraph 45 of its omnibus report (A/54/841).
Additional requirements of $1,794,900 over the amount of $4,025,700 apportioned for the previous budget period are proposed under transport operations for 2000/01.
Estimates provide for non-recurrent costs amounting to $3,950,843 for the replacement of 39 vehicles and the purchase of an additional 50 special types of vehicles.
Under supplies and services, the proposed increase of $51,500 over the appropriated amount of $1,315,900 is the result of the reallocation of requirements for contractual services, as indicated in paragraph 13 of annex I.C.
Some decreases are proposed under operational costs, such as for communications, which is budgeted at $481,700 compared with $625,300 for the previous period, and other equipment, which is budgeted at $866,200, compared with $1,103,000 for the previous period.
Estimates of the direct support provided by the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization to UNDOF are contained in annex III to the budget document.
In this regard, the Advisory Committee notes that for the two-year period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2001, the associated costs amount to $8,382,400, compared with $8,903,300 for the period from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 1999.
The Advisory Committee also recalls that the General Assembly, in its resolution 53/226 of 8 June 1999, upon the recommendation of the Committee (A/53/895/Add.1, para.
14), requested the Secretary-General to credit back to Member States, in a phased manner and within three years, the net balance of $13.6 million withheld as a result of the suspension of regulation 4.3 of the Financial Regulations of the United Nations.
Under the terms of the same resolution an amount of $5.6 million was credited back to Member States during the fifty-third session of the Assembly.
The Committee notes, as indicated in paragraph 31 of the budget document, that the Secretary-General is proposing to credit back to Member States, during the fifty-fourth session, an amount of $4,022,162, taking into account the current cash position of the Force, and to credit the remaining balance of $4,000,000 during the fifty-fifth session (2001), subject to the cash position of UNDOF at that time.
The Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
The Committee further notes that the Assembly, in paragraph 7 of its resolution 53/226, requested the Secretary-General to expedite the process of improving the working conditions of the Force.
This issue and the measures taken by the UNDOF administration are indicated in paragraphs 32 to 34 of the budget document.
Paragraph 3 of the budget report outlines the actions to be taken by the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session in connection with the financing of UNDOF.
The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the Secretary-General's proposal that the Assembly appropriate the amount of $34,946,700 gross ($34,195,300 net) for the 12-month period beginning 1 July 2000, to be assessed at a monthly rate of $2,912,225 gross ($2,849,608 net), subject to the extension of the mandate of the Force by the Security Council beyond 31 May 2000.
The Committee also recommends that the Member States be credited, during the fifty-fourth session of the Assembly, the amount of $4,022,162 as part of the remaining net surplus balance held in the suspense account of UNDOF, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 13 of resolution 53/226.

Financing of the United Nations peacekeeping forces in the Middle East: United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the performance report for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 (A/54/708) and the proposed budget for UNIFIL for the 12-month period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 (A/54/724).
During its consideration of these reports, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General and the Chief Administrative Officer of the mission, who provided additional information.
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon was established by the Security Council in its resolution 425 (1978) of 19 March 1978 for operations in southern Lebanon.
The mission's mandate has been extended several times by the Council, most recently in its resolution 1288 (2000) of 31 January 2000, by which the Council extended the mandate of the Force until 31 July 2000.
Cash balances as at 31 January 2000 amounted to $127.4 million.
Furthermore, the Advisory Committee was informed that troop-contributing countries had received payments totalling $860,345,895 for the period from 1 December 1989 to 30 April 1999, and that an estimated amount of $38,632,863 was still due for the period from 1 May to 31 December 1999.
Performance report for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999
The report of the Secretary-General on the financial performance of UNIFIL for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 (A/54/708) outlines the action to be taken by the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session in connection with the financing of the Force.
Paragraph 12 and table 1 of the report indicate that total resources made available to UNIFIL for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 amounted to $142,984,560 gross ($139,133,100 net), inclusive of the amount of $7,152,700 for the support account for peacekeeping operations.
Expenditures amounted to $134,655,200 gross ($131,048,500 net), resulting in an unencumbered balance of $8,329,300 gross ($8,084,600 net).
This balance, which represents approximately 5.8 per cent in gross terms of the amount appropriated, was due largely to lower than budgeted actual troop strength, a high vacancy rate for civilian staff, savings under vehicles resulting from favourable unit cost rates obtained for the purchase of vehicles under a systems contract and the receipt of other vehicles, equipment and supplies from the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy.
The Advisory Committee notes, as indicated in paragraph 12 and table 1 of the performance document, that unliquidated obligations amounted to $52,136,300 as at 30 June 1999.
The Advisory Committee was also informed of a contingent liability, estimated at $1,486,652, related to equipment brought to the mission by troop contributors for which no provision was included in the budget and therefore was not reflected in the financial statements.
The Committee was informed that this had been an inadvertent omission, but that action had been taken to avoid a recurrence in future.
The Committee recommends that proposals to deal with this liability be presented in the context of the next budget submission for UNIFIL.
Savings of $2,384,400 are reported under military personnel costs.
These were mostly due to the deployment of a lower average number of troops, an average strength of 4,499 military contingents compared with an authorized strength of 4,513, as shown in table 2 of the performance document, and lower actual costs for ration requirements for the period between the expiry of an old contract and the award of a new one, effective 1 April 1999.
As indicated in paragraph 11 of the report, while the competitive bidding was under way, interim arrangements were made for the local purchase of dry and frozen rations as well as for the use of reserve stock.
Savings of $3,337,500 are recorded under civilian personnel costs, resulting mostly from an international staff vacancy rate of 14 per cent owing to the temporary assignment of staff to other missions.
Under operational requirements, savings amounting to $3,565,500 (12 per cent) are indicated out of an apportionment of $27,840,100.
In this regard, the Advisory Committee notes that savings of $75,000 are indicated under premises and accommodation owing to the reimbursement by the Government of Lebanon of the rental charge of $132,000 for UNIFIL House in Beirut during this period.
Under-expenditures of $3,663,500, out of an apportionment of $14,937,100, are also reported under transport operations, as a result of the transfer of 10 heavy vehicles and spare parts from the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, favourable per vehicle costs as a result of a systems contract, discounts for spare parts, lower prices for gasoline, diesel fuel and kerosene, and lower vehicle insurance premiums for general-purpose vehicles.
Offsetting these under-expenditures, additional requirements of $634,000, as compared with the initial provision of $2,463,400, are indicated under other equipment, due mostly to the purchase of computer hardware and software and the upgrading of the local computer network to ensure year-2000 compliance.
Paragraph 14 of the report indicates that the action to be taken by the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session in connection with the financing of UNIFIL is a decision on the treatment of the unencumbered balance of $8,329,300 gross ($8,084,600 net) for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999.
The Advisory Committee recommends that Member States be credited their respective shares of the unencumbered balance for the period in question in a manner to be determined by the General Assembly.
Proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001
The cost estimates submitted by the Secretary-General for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 (A/54/724) amount to $139,547,600 gross ($135,721,900 net), inclusive of a $180,000 budgeted voluntary contribution.
The latter relates to the contribution by the Government of Lebanon of the UNIFIL House in Beirut since February 1998.
This estimate reflects a net decrease of $541,600 in resources, or 0.4 per cent, compared with the resources of $139,909,200 approved for the previous 12-month period, resulting from decreases under civilian personnel costs, operational requirements and staff assessment costs, which were partially offset by increases under military personnel and other programmes.
The proposed budget provides for the maintenance of the Force, which comprises 4,513 troops supported by a civilian establishment of 491 staff, including 141 international and 350 local posts.
The Advisory Committee was informed that as at 31 December 1999 there were 4,493 troops in UNIFIL; of the 146 authorized international staff posts, 106 were encumbered, and all of the 344 authorized local staff posts were encumbered.
The proposed budget reflects an increase of $745,600, or a 1.0 per cent increase in military personnel costs over the amount apportioned for 1999/00, resulting from additional requirements of $144,300 under contingent-owned equipment to cover the wet-lease costs for crew-served weapons ($296,820), patrol dogs ($26,850) and ammunition ($361,630).
The increase also reflects the first-time provision for reimbursement for self-sustainment ($550,143), as indicated in paragraph 19 of the budget document, in accordance with General Assembly procedures.
In this regard, the Advisory Committee was informed that on 15 February 2000 a memorandum of understanding had been signed with a troop contributor to cover equipment and self-sustainment.
The Advisory Committee recalls that in its previous report on the financing of UNIFIL (A/53/895/Add.1, para.
43) it had indicated that the Secretariat was drawing up a plan to introduce the new contingent-owned equipment arrangements to UNIFIL.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that aside from the reluctance of its troop contributors to convert to new contingent-owned equipment arrangements, the other factor slowing the change was the fact that much of the equipment was owned by the United Nations, and therefore extensive discussions and negotiations were required with the troop contributors involved.
The Advisory Committee was also informed that most crew-served weapons, which had been in use by the mission since the biennium 1986-1987, were in urgent need of replacement.
After a survey was conducted and recommendations were made for replacement and improved maintenance practices, the transition to wet-lease provision and maintenance was expected to be implemented by 2000/01 and budgeted for accordingly, as indicated in paragraph 15 above.
The proposed requirements under civilian personnel costs, which amount to $25,560,200, reflect a 1.9 per cent decrease in comparison with the budget for the previous period.
The total staffing component of 491 posts would consist of 141 international (23 Professional, 41 General Service and 77 Field Service) and 350 local staff, compared with the staff authorized for the current period, which also totals 491 posts, including 147 international (22 Professional, 45 General Service and 80 Field Service) and 344 local staff.
As indicated in paragraphs 21-23 of the report, the proposed staffing would include the establishment of one new P-3 post, for a Supply Management Officer, the reclassification of a Budget Cost Control Officer post from P-3 to P-4 and a Civilian Engineer post from P-2 to P-3, the abolition of a General Service post in the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer, the redeployment of a Field Service post to that office from the Communications Section and the conversion of three General Service and three Field Service posts into six Local-level posts, of which three would be assigned to the Electronic Data Processing Section and three to cleaner/kitchen-helper functions for battalions and the Force Mobile Reserve.
Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the three local staff posts proposed were part of the 38 previously requested by the Secretary-General in his budget for 1998/99.
Those three local workers, hired since the 1980s, are currently charged against General Service posts, which now need to be re-allocated.
The conversion of those posts would result in a cost reduction of $88,400 in the proposed budget, consistent with the request of the General Assembly in its resolution 53/227 of 8 June 1999, in which it requested the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to recruit local staff in order to reduce the cost of employing General Service staff.
The Committee recommends acceptance of the staffing changes proposed by the Secretary-General.
A vacancy factor of 5 per cent is incorporated for international staff, based on experience, as indicated in paragraph 5 of annex I.C. No vacancy factor is incorporated for local staff.
The Advisory Committee notes, however, that the average vacancy rate for international staff was 10 per cent for 1997/98 and 14 per cent for 1998/99, as indicated in paragraph 10 above.
For the period 1999/00, the Committee was informed that as at 31 December 1999, of the 146 authorized international posts, 106 were encumbered.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that if an 8 per cent vacancy factor were applied to international staff, total costs would amount to $16,580,884 instead of $17,121,565.
The Committee believes that a vacancy factor of 8 per cent would better reflect reality and past experience.
The Advisory Committee recalls that in its previous report (A/53/895/Add.1, para. 47) it referred to the use of mission appointees and the fact that it had been informed that there were no staff under the 300 series rules in UNIFIL, the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus, or the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, since they were considered established duty stations.
The Committee also indicated that, upon enquiry, it had been informed that there were no operational impediments to prevent the hiring of 300-series employees.
The Committee sought additional information in this regard and was informed by a representative of the Office of Human Resources Management of the current practices with regard to the use of limited duration contracts that relate to two pilot schemes (one at the United Nations, another at the United Nations Development Programme), which were approved by the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) and endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 52/216 of 22 December 1997 (see also para. 25 of the Committee's omnibus report on the financing of peacekeeping operations A/54/841).
The Committee notes that ICSC is expected to continue its discussions on the issue of appointments of limited duration based on the experience obtained up to now with both pilot projects at its summer session in 2000.
The proposed budget reflects a 2.7 per cent decrease in operational costs, from $30,695,700 to $29,871,100, compared with the budget for 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000, and includes non-recurrent requirements of $11,690,300.
In this connection, non-recurrent provisions of $6,658,216 for the replacement of 118 vehicles, out of a fleet of 1,085 in current inventory, based on established replacement policy, and of $223,000 for workshop equipment are included under transport operations.
The increase of $1,009,900 under petrol, oil and lubricants, as indicated in paragraph 13 of annex I.C, takes into account the latest market prices as at January 2000.
The increase from $2,693,400 to $2,867,800 under premises and accommodation includes non-recurrent costs of $1,328,000 for the maintenance, asphalting and sealing of the existing road system within the area of operations.
The Advisory Committee also notes that the proposed requirements under other equipment increase from $2,817,600 to $3,345,200.
In this regard, non-recurrent costs of $2,226,200 relate to the replacement of obsolete or worn-out equipment, as detailed in annex II.C, including a provision of $846,650 under electronic data-processing equipment.
The Committee notes from paragraph 17 of annex I.C that the Force is proposing to replace 132 desktop computers and 14 laptops, or 25 per cent of the current holdings of 526 and 55 respectively.
Moreover, UNIFIL has replaced 254 desktop computers and 38 laptops during the last three financial periods.
The views of the Committee on the replacement cycle of data-processing equipment are contained in paragraphs 35 and 36 of its omnibus report (A/54/841).
In view of the resources requested by UNIFIL under this budget item in the past, the Advisory Committee recommends that at this time UNIFIL replace only 20 per cent of its total holdings of data-processing equipment (requirements would amount to $438,650), which, along with the provision for $358,500 for additional purchases, totals $797,150 instead of the $846,650 mentioned above.
The Advisory Committee notes that the estimates of the direct support provided by the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization to UNIFIL is provided in annex III to the budget document.
In this regard, the Committee notes, for the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2001, that the associated costs amount to $4,853,900 — a decrease of $398,500 compared with the previous biennium.
The Advisory Committee recalls that in paragraph 11 of its resolution 53/227, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures to ensure the full implementation of the decisions of the Assembly regarding the Qana incident and to report on that matter to the Assembly at its fifty-fourth session.
In this regard, the Committee notes that information is provided in paragraphs 25 and 26 of the budget report indicating that the amount of $1,284,633 had been recorded under accounts receivable for UNIFIL and that the Secretariat had addressed three letters to the Permanent Representative of Israel, to which no response had yet been received.
The actions to be taken by the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session in connection with the financing of UNIFIL are outlined in paragraph 3 of the report.
The Secretary-General proposes that the Assembly appropriate an amount of $139,367,600 gross ($135,541,900 net) for the 12-month period beginning on 1 July 2000, to be assessed at the monthly rate of $11,613,966 gross ($11,295,158 net), subject to the extension of the mandate of the Force by the Security Council beyond 31 July 2000.
The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the Secretary-General's proposal, after adjustment for the reductions of $540,681 and $49,500 recommended by the Committee in paragraphs 20 and 24 above.

Financing of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus
Financing of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financial performance of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 (A/54/704) and on the proposed budget for the 12-month period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 (A/54/729).
During its consideration of the reports, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, including the Chief Administrative Officer of UNFICYP, who provided additional information and clarifications.
UNFICYP was established by the Security Council on 4 March 1964.
From its inception until 15 June 1993, the costs of the Force were met by Governments providing contingents, by the Government of Cyprus and by voluntary contributions to UNFICYP.
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 47/236 of 14 September 1993, the costs of the Force since 16 June 1993 that were not covered by voluntary contributions have been assessed on Member States.
Voluntary contributions equal to one third of the annual cost of UNFICYP have been made on a continuing basis by the Government of Cyprus, while the Government of Greece has been making an annual contribution of $6.5 million.
Financial performance for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999
The amount approved by the General Assembly for the maintenance of UNFICYP for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 was $45,276,160 gross ($43,536,860 net), including the portion to be met through voluntary contributions from the Governments of Cyprus and Greece as well as $2,267,160 appropriated for the support account for peacekeeping operations by the General Assembly in its resolution 52/241 of 26 June 1998.
Recorded expenditures amounted to $44,902,200 gross ($43,115,200 net), resulting in an unencumbered balance of $374,000 gross ($421,700 net).
The unencumbered balance resulted mainly from lower travel costs under civilian police personnel and lower operational cost requirements under transport operations, supplies and services, communications and infrastructure repairs.
As indicated in annex II, paragraph 1, of the performance report (A/54/704), the unutilized balance of $87,200 under civilian police costs was largely attributable to the fact that one Government providing civilian police does not seek reimbursement for its repatriation/rotation costs.
In this connection, the Advisory Committee recalls paragraph 33 of its report of 7 May 1998 on the financing of United Nations peacekeeping operations (A/52/860), in which it requested that the Secretariat ascertain, in such cases, whether or not a claim will be submitted by the country concerned and to take the results into account when preparing future budgets of the missions.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that, in accordance with the recommendation of the Committee, the savings were taken into account when the 2000-2001 budget was prepared.
An unutilized balance of $713,400 resulted from reduced operational requirements, including unspent balances under infrastructure repairs ($56,900), transport operations ($479,400), communications ($126,500) and supplies and services ($368,900), offset in part by additional requirements under premises/accommodation ($147,700), air operations ($8,900), and other equipment ($161,700).
The Advisory Committee was informed that troop cost reimbursement up to 30 April 1999 totalled $90,624,736, while the amount owed for the period from 1 May to 31 December 1999 was $10,697,069.
With regard to contingent-owned equipment, the Committee was informed that, as at 31 December 1999, the amount reimbursed was $4,140,623 and the amount owed was $12,278,698.
Unliquidated obligations in respect of contingent-owned equipment as at 31 December 1999 amounted to $6,233,343.
Under death and disability compensation, the Committee was informed that $214,718 had been paid as at 31 December 1999 for 15 claims, leaving a balance of $1,100,000 in unliquidated obligations and 3 pending claims.
The Committee was informed that the cash position of UNFICYP as at 31 December 1999 was $18.6 million.
The Advisory Committee was also informed that the total amount assessed on Member States for UNFICYP for the period from 16 June 1993 to 31 December 1999 was $150.2 million, against which the payments received amounted to $134.0 million, leaving an outstanding balance of $16.2 million.
The Advisory Committee notes the continued economy and efficiency measures undertaken by the Mission to reduce operational costs.
One example of this is the analysis conducted by the Mission of the premises needing repair in the United Nations Protected Area, with a view to rationalizing the use of space, and to determining the actual needs of the Force.
As a result of the analysis, the Force is currently in the process of vacating unneeded space.
Another example is the institution by the mission of a new, more refined method of authorizing the use of helicopters for strictly operational purposes, which has resulted in improved control of flight hours.
The Committee welcomes such measures.
The Advisory Committee also commends the Mission for the measures it has taken to improve and strengthen procurement services.
The Committee was informed that a staff member with expertise in procurement had been posted to the mission and that training of other mission personnel had been conducted.
Procurement planning had been improved, with an emphasis on streamlining and focusing requirements, and extensive advertising, including wide use of the Internet, had been employed.
After a careful analysis of comparative costs, purchases are made either locally or from outside the region.
The Committee was informed that there was close cooperation between the procurement services of the mission and those of Headquarters.
In addition, a regional meeting of chief administrative officers of missions in the Middle East is being held to share best practices in procurement and other areas.
Furthermore, the Committee was informed of the intention of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to review all procurement practices in missions in order to benefit from lessons learned.
The Committee welcomes the initiative.
The measures taken to improve procurement in the mission have led to considerable savings.
In the context of the performance report for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999, savings were realized, for example, under communications equipment, where local procurement resulted in savings of $37,500, and under contractual services, where local competitive bidding led to savings of $312,800 for laundry and dry cleaning services (see A/54/704, annex II, paras.
With regard to military costs, the Advisory Committee recalls its recommendation in paragraph 8 of its report of 5 April 1999 (A/53/895/Add.3) that, in the case of the contingent that has required rotation every five and one half months instead of the normal six-month rotation, the administration should look into the matter with a view to convincing the troop contributor to bear the cost of any additional rotation this arrangement would entail.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that efforts were under way to reach an understanding with the troop-contributing country concerned that rotation would henceforth be on a six-month basis.
The Advisory Committee requested clarification on the policy for payment of war-risk insurance for aircraft acquired under letter-of-assist arrangements, as referred to in annex II, paragraph 6, of the performance report.
As this issue is of relevance to a number of peacekeeping missions, the information provided to the Committee is reflected in its general report on financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations (see A/54/841, para.
The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNFICYP for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 is indicated in paragraph 10 of the performance report (A/54/704).
The Advisory Committee recommends that the unencumbered balance of $374,000 gross ($421,700 net) for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 be credited to Member States in a manner to be decided by the General Assembly.
Information on performance for the current period
The Advisory Committee was informed that, against the authorized staffing establishment of UNFICYP for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 of 1,230 troops, 35 civilian police, 44 international staff and 215 local staff, encumbered posts as at 31 December 1999 were 1,206 troops, 35 civilian police, 39 international staff and 197 local staff.
The Advisory Committee was provided with expenditure data for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000, as at 31 December 1999. Expenditure for the period amounted to $34,743,200, against an apportionment of $43,892,300.
Cost estimates for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001
As indicated in paragraph 1 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/54/729) on the proposed budget for the maintenance of the Force for the 12-month period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001, an amount of $41,039,800 gross ($39,374,200 net) has been requested.
This request represents a 4.5 per cent decrease ($1,875,100) in gross terms in relation to the apportionment for the current period ending 30 June 2000.
The proposed budget reflects decreases of $521,400, or 2.3 per cent, in military personnel costs; $765,500, or 7.6 per cent, in civilian personnel costs; $534,800, or 6.6 per cent, in operational costs; and $72,900, or 4.2 per cent, in staff assessment, offset by an increase of $19,500, or 98.5 per cent, in other programmes.
With regard to the presentation of the budget report, the Advisory Committee notes that some of the information provided in section IV (Contributions made under the status-of-forces agreement) is being disclosed for the first time.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that all of the amounts in the table in section IV, apart from the first entry, were additional to the budgeted amounts paid by the Governments of Cyprus and Greece.
The total cost of the mission is therefore larger than previously disclosed.
In future budget submissions, the Committee requests that the same procedure be used for UNFICYP as is used for the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission, that is, such contributions should be included under section V of the report (Voluntary contributions).
The proposed military personnel of UNFICYP remain at 1,230.
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 2 of annex I.C to the budget report (A/54/729) that a 5 per cent non-utilization factor has been applied in respect of rations for military personnel.1 This has resulted in a downward adjustment of the estimated requirements by $161,400.
The Committee enquired as to the extent to which that practice was followed in other missions, and was informed that non-utilization factors were applied in the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (14 days per person per year), as well as the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force (3.5 per cent).
The proposed civilian staffing of the mission comprises 35 civilian police, 44 international staff and 186 local staff.
This reflects a decrease of 29 local staff posts resulting from the outsourcing of cleaning and catering services, as recommended by the Advisory Committee in its report of 3 April 1998 (A/52/860/Add.4, para.
19). The Committee was informed that those local staff affected, to the extent possible, had been absorbed in vacant posts; others had been let go after the termination of their contracts.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the abolition of the 29 posts had resulted in savings of $708,900 gross.
The costs of the contracts for janitorial and cleaning services were $225,100 and $423,000 respectively, leaving a net savings as a result of outsourcing of $135,000.
The Committee welcomes the contracting out of these services and the consequent savings achieved.
Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the contracting out of services had been undertaken at Force headquarters.
A study is under way to determine the feasibility of outsourcing similar services in the field sectors.
In this connection, the Advisory Committee welcomes the intention of UNFICYP, as stated in paragraph 14 of the budget report (A/54/729), to continue its efforts towards outsourcing non-core, labour-intensive functions while at the same time enhancing management, supervisory and specialized technical functions.
The Committee encourages the completion of the study and requests that the results be incorporated in the estimates for the next financial period and be made available to other missions.
The Advisory Committee was informed that cost estimates for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 were based on a 5 per cent vacancy factor in respect of international staff and a zero vacancy factor for local staff.
The Committee notes that these rates are lower than those in the performance report for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 (A/54/704), which were 8 per cent and 1 per cent respectively.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that, owing to the size of the mission and the relatively low vacancy rate it was considered prudent to use 5 per cent and zero vacancy factors.
In the case of local staff, zero was used because the mission was attempting to absorb in vacant posts some of the 29 staff whose posts had been abolished as a result of the outsourcing of cleaning and catering services.
Taking this specific situation into account, the Committee supports the use of a zero vacancy factor for local staff, but is of the opinion that the rates used for international staff are not borne out by past experience.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that, as at 31 December 1999, there were 11 mission appointees at UNFICYP.
The Committee encourages a greater use of this type of staff.
As indicated in paragraph 19 of annex I.C to the budget report (A/54/729), the estimates for other equipment include provision for replacement of 20 per cent of the electronic data-processing equipment.
In other missions, the replacement rate is 25 per cent.
The Advisory Committee notes that the focus in this area is on replacement of equipment that is “obsolete, and/or uneconomical to repair”.
This is in line with the view of the Committee that the 25 per cent ratio should not be applied mechanically (see A/54/841, paras.
The Committee encourages other missions to follow similar rigorous examination of their inventory before deciding on new requisitions.
The Advisory Committee notes from annex II to the budget report (A/54/729) that $20,000 is requested under data-processing services, as against $18,000 for the current period.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the increase was the direct result of the anticipated price increase in Sun and ProGen systems software licensing fees for the 2000/01 financial period.
The Committee was also informed that the criteria used to determine whether to purchase or lease data-processing systems were availability and best value to the Organization.
Currently, hardware is being purchased, while options for leasing are being investigated.
Software for personal computers is purchased on payment of a one-time licensing fee, while administrative application software, such as Sun Microsystems, ProGen and Reality are only available as lease/purchase with annual maintenance/renewal options, and therefore cannot be purchased.
The Committee was also informed that the Information Technology Services Division has set specification standards for hardware such as servers, workstations, etc. Those standards are followed for mission purchases made by United Nations Headquarters.
Although there are software standards as well, the missions are obliged to use their discretion in order to satisfy local requirements such as language support.
The Advisory Committee notes the considerable increase in the estimates for training programmes, from $15,000 for the current period ending 30 June 2000 to $34,500 for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that $34,500 represented the full cost of the training programme, including related travel and other costs.
The Committee was also provided, upon request, with a breakdown of the training planned for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001.
The Committee welcomes the emphasis on training and intends to monitor training programmes to ascertain if the increase in expenditure is commensurate with the benefit accrued to missions.
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 21 of annex I.C to the budget report (A/54/729) that requirements for procurement training are estimated at $6,000.
In view of the considerable decentralization in procurement services to the field, the Committee recommends a much more focused procurement training programme involving procurement personnel from all the missions in the area.
In this connection, the Committee was informed that training had already been undertaken for finance officers on appointment, and that training of procurement officers was under consideration.
Such shared training could be organized either under the aegis of the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi or UNFICYP.
The Advisory Committee is also of the view that more training should be given in all aspects of contract management.
The Advisory Committee recommends that in the context of future budgets the number of personnel trained, the related costs and the areas of training should be included in the supplementary information supplied to the Committee.
It is also of the view that before selecting personnel to be trained the actual availability of the staff member for mission service should be confirmed by the Administration.
Estimates in annex II.A under other travel reflect an increase of 58 per cent.
The Advisory Committee was informed that the amount of $30,900 estimated for travel of the Office of Internal Oversight Services was based on the assumption that three auditors would travel to the mission and stay for a period of 28 days at an estimated cost of $10,300 per person for airfare and subsistence.
The number of auditors and the length of stay take into account the possibility of expansion in the activities of the mission in the event of a breakthrough in the ongoing United Nations efforts there.
Upon request, the Committee was provided with a detailed breakdown of all travel costs.
The Advisory Committee has stated that organizations seeking the help of UNFICYP should reimburse the Force (A/51/851, para.
40). The Committee notes the information in annex III regarding assistance provided by UNFICYP to various entities in the mission area, and reiterates its recommendation that care should be taken to avoid the establishment of elaborate and costly recovery methods which might not be commensurate with the amounts to be recovered.
The Committee requests that the costs involved be carefully monitored and that reimbursement be sought wherever appropriate, taking into account the guidelines given by the Committee.
The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNFICYP for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 are indicated in paragraph 3 of the budget report (A/54/729).
The Advisory Committee recommends that the amount of $41,039,800 gross ($39,374,200 net) be approved for the maintenance of UNFICYP for the 12-month period beginning 1 July 2000, including the amount of $19,624,735 net representing voluntary contributions from the Governments of Cyprus and Greece.

Agenda item 131
Financing of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
Financing of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financial performance of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 (A/54/780) and on the proposed budget for the 12-month period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 (A/54/785).
During its consideration of the reports, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information and clarifications.
MINURSO was established by the Security Council in its resolution 690 (1991) of 29 April 1991 for an initial period of six months.
Since then, its mandate has been extended by the Security Council in various resolutions, the latest being resolution 1292 (2000) of 29 February 2000, by which the Council further extended the mandate of the Mission until 31 May 2000.
Financial performance report for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999
In its resolutions 52/228 B of 26 June 1998 and 53/18 A of 2 November 1998, the General Assembly appropriated an amount of $60 million gross ($55,918,800 net) for the maintenance of MINURSO for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999.
Of that appropriation, $46,031,077 gross ($43,001,827 net) has been assessed on Member States.
Expenditures for the period totalled $44,607,700 gross ($42,398,200 net), resulting in an unutilized balance of appropriation of $15,392,300 gross ($13,520,600 net), or 26 per cent of the total appropriation, and an unutilized balance of assessments of $1,423,377 gross ($603,627 net).
The unutilized balances resulted mainly from the suspension of the process of identification of eligible voters in the referendum for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara between August 1998 and June 1999 pending the outcome of United Nations consultations with the parties to resolve difficulties in identifying applicants from certain tribal groupings.
With regard to military personnel, an unutilized balance of $2,941,300 resulted from repatriation of the engineering unit, which was carried out because of the uncertainty as to the resumption of identification activities.
Pending the conclusion of political consultations and the resolution of the impasse, civilian police whose tours of duty had ended and Identification Commission personnel whose contracts expired on 31 December 1998 were not replaced, resulting in a significantly higher than anticipated vacancy rates for civilian police and international civilian personnel (38 and 29 per cent respectively) and an unutilized balance of $7,633,500 under civilian personnel costs.
The suspension of identification activities also accounted for a reduction of $2,822,000 in operational requirements, which included the early termination of a hire contract for one MI-8 helicopter and the utilization of fewer flight hours than originally budgeted, as well as the non-utilization of funds for hotel accommodations for Identification Commission staff.
The Advisory Committee was informed that troop cost reimbursement from 1 September 1991 to 30 April 1999 totalled $5.7 million, while the amount owed for the period from l May 1999 to 29 February 2000 was $229,472.
With regard to contingent-owned equipment, the Committee was informed that the amount owed as at 29 February 2000 was $5.1 million and that there had been no reimbursement to troop-contributing countries as at that date.
Unliquidated obligations in respect of contingent-owned equipment as at 29 February 2000 amounted to $6.0 million.
Under death and disability compensation, the Committee was informed that $317,560 had been paid as at 29 February 2000 for 12 claims, leaving a balance of $562,136 in unliquidated obligations and one pending claim.
The Committee was informed that the cash position of MINURSO as at 29 February 2000 was $7.7 million, unliquidated obligations for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 amounted to $3.2 million and current loans totalled $20.6 million.
The Advisory Committee was also informed that the total amount assessed on Member States for MINURSO for the period from 29 April 1991 to 29 February 2000 was $391.4 million, against which the payments received amounted to $322.2 million, leaving an outstanding balance of $69.2 million.
The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of MINURSO for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 are indicated in paragraph 17 of the performance report (A/54/780).
In view of the unforeseen changes in the implementation of the mandate of the Mission, the Advisory Committee recommends reduction of the appropriation provided in General Assembly resolutions 52/228 B and 53/18 A for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 from $60 million gross ($55,918,800 net) to $46,031,077 gross ($43,001,827 net) corresponding to the amount actually assessed on Member States.
The Committee also recommends that the unutilized balance of $1,423,377 gross ($603,627 net), based on the reduced appropriation recommended above, be credited to Member States in a manner to be decided by the General Assembly.
Information on performance for the current period
The Advisory Committee was informed that, against the authorized staffing establishment of MINURSO for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 of 27 military contingents, 203 military observers, 81 civilian police, 328 international staff, 113 local staff and 10 observers from the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the posts encumbered as at 29 February 2000 were 27 military contingents, 200 military observers, 80 civilian police, 290 international staff, 109 local staff and 8 OAU observers.
The Advisory Committee was provided with expenditure data for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 as at 29 February 2000.
Expenditure for the period amounted to $30,129,400 against an apportionment of $51,752,400.
Cost estimates for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001
As indicated in paragraph 1 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/54/785), an amount of $46,611,600 gross ($42,772,800 net) has been requested for the maintenance of MINURSO for the 12-month period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001.
This request represents a 5 per cent decrease ($2,411,400) in gross terms in relation to the apportionment for the current period ending 30 June 2000.
The proposed budget reflects decreases of $167,600, or 2 per cent, in military personnel costs; $916,500, or 4 per cent, in civilian personnel costs; $1,232,500, or 11 per cent, in operational requirements; and $112,800, or 3 per cent, in staff assessment, offset by an increase of $18,000, or 100 per cent, in other programmes.
The Advisory Committee takes note of the intractable problems faced by MINURSO in the implementation of the settlement plan (see paras. 32-37 of the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council dated 17 February 2000 (S/2000/131)).
Implementation of the plan has been impeded by fundamental differences between the parties over the interpretation of the main provisions of the plan, most notably the issue of the establishment of the electorate.
The Committee takes note of the statement by the Secretary-General in paragraph 33 of his report to the Security Council that “the two parties seem to share the belief that the composition of the electoral body will predetermine the outcome of the referendum”.
Therefore, over the period of almost nine years since the establishment of MINURSO, one or the other party has at different times withheld cooperation with the process of identification of eligible voters.
The same underlying problems are likely to pervade the appeals process.
The Advisory Committee was informed that, as of 25 February 2000, a total of 86,411 applicants out of some 200,000 had been found eligible to vote in the referendum.
In accordance with MINURSO appeals procedures, all those excluded from the provisional voter list have the right to appeal, while those found eligible can also challenge the inclusion of others.
The Committee was informed that, as at 25 February 2000, almost 52,000 appeals had been received in connection with second part of the voter list.
Together with the 79,000 appeals received from the first part of the voter list, this brings the total number of appeals received to over 130,000.
In addition, several other issues remain to be settled, such as the establishment of a protocol for the repatriation of Saharan refugees acceptable to all parties concerned and agreement on what would constitute appropriate security conditions for voting in the Territory.
The Secretary-General has stated his intention to request his Personal Envoy to consult with the parties to explore ways and means to achieve an early, durable and agreed resolution to their dispute that would define their respective rights and obligations in Western Sahara.
The Committee was informed that the Secretary-General would report to the Security Council towards the end of May 2000 on the results of those consultations.
The proposed budget reflects an increase in the international staffing establishment by 20 posts (12 posts at the P-4 level for additional Identification Commission members, 4 posts at the P-3 level for registration officers and 4 Field Service posts (one electronic data-processing assistant, one administrative assistant and two air support/movement control assistants)).
An additional 18 local-level posts are also requested to support the activities of the Identification Commission.
As indicated in paragraph 18 of the proposed budget, the additional posts are required to support and accelerate data processing with respect to activities at the 13 appeals centres.
This would increase international staffing from 280 for the current period to 300 for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001, and local staffing from 95 for the current period to 113 for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001.
In this connection, the Committee recalls its letter dated 6 October 1999, in which it concurred in the increase in staffing by 48 international and 18 local-level posts in connection with the operation of identification and appeals centres, and notes that the staffing requested for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 actually represents a decrease in staffing from the levels approved in October.
The Advisory Committee notes, as indicated in paragraph 8 of annex I.C of the proposed budget, that, based on the recent actual incumbency situation in MINURSO, the estimated international and local staff costs for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 reflect the application of vacancy factors of 35 per cent for Professional staff, 10 per cent for General Service and Field Service staff and 5 per cent for local staff.
Incumbency for the current period, as indicated to the Committee, is mentioned in paragraph 9 above.
The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of MINURSO for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 are set out in paragraph 3 of the proposed budget (A/54/785).
The Advisory Committee recommends that the amount of $46,611,600 gross ($42,772,800 net) be approved for the maintenance of MINURSO for the 12-month period beginning 1 July 2000, and that that amount be assessed at a monthly rate of $3,884,300 gross ($3,564,400 net) should the Security Council decide to extend the mandate of MINURSO beyond 31 May 2000.

Financing of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo
Financing of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 (A/54/807).
During its consideration of the report, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided the Committee with additional information and clarifications.
The report of the Secretary-General was submitted to the Committee in the form of an advance text in one language only (English), just a few days before the end of the Committee's session.
UNMIK was established by the Security Council in resolution 1244 (1999) of 10 June 1999 for an initial period of 12 months, to continue thereafter unless the Security Council decided otherwise.
The General Assembly, by its resolution 54/245 of 23 December 1999, decided to appropriate the amount of $427,061,800 gross ($410,091,700 net) for the establishment and maintenance of UNMIK for the period from 10 June 1999 to 30 June 2000, inclusive of the amount of $200 million authorized by the General Assembly in its resolution 53/241 of 28 July 1999.
The Advisory Committee was informed that of the total amount of the assessment of $415.2 million for the period from 10 June 1999 to 30 June 2000, an amount of $189.6 million had been received as at 21 March 2000, leaving an outstanding balance of contributions of $225.6 million.
The updated financial situation of UNMIK is as follows:
(a) Cash position (as at 21 March 2000) — $90.5 million;
(b) Expenditures (as at 31 December 1999, including unliquidated obligations of $64.0 million) — $128.2 million.
The estimated requirements of UNMIK for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 amount to $461,380,600 gross ($434,981,000 net) and provide for a total strength of 9,754 personnel, including 38 military liaison officers, 4,718 civilian police, 1,207 international staff, 3,578 local staff, 10 National Officers and 203 United Nations Volunteers (in addition, 500 United Nations Volunteers would be required for three months, from July to September 2000).
The proposed budget represents an 8.0 per cent increase ($34,318,800) in total resources (gross) in relation to the apportionment for the financial period ending 30 June 2000.
The proposed staffing structure of the Mission reflects a net increase of 353 posts, including 59 posts in the category of international staff and 296 posts in the category of local staff, offset slightly by a decrease of 2 posts of National Officers.
In section I, Overview, of the proposed budget for UNMIK (see A/54/807), table 1 in paragraph 2 provides a comparison between the estimated requirements for the coming financial period and the apportionment for the period ending 30 June 2000, by major category of expenditure.
As indicated in the table, the estimated requirements reflect a 208.6 per cent increase in military personnel costs, a 52.1 per cent increase in civilian personnel costs, a 55.6 per cent increase in staff assessment, a 48.8 per cent decrease in operational requirements and a 62.9 per cent decrease in other programmes.
The Advisory Committee was informed that the incumbency situation of UNMIK was as follows as at 29 February 2000:
The political mandate of the Mission is outlined in section II of the proposed budget for UNMIK; section III thereof deals with the operational plan and requirements (see A/54/807).
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 6 of the report of the Secretary-General that “UNHCR will phase out its operations by mid-2000 as the need for a prolonged, large-scale humanitarian role in Kosovo after the winter is not foreseen”.
The Committee recalls its statement in paragraph 56 of its last report on UNMIK (A/54/622) that it:
“understands that preparations for the UNMIK budget for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 will be under way almost as soon as the current submission is approved by the General Assembly in order for it to be available for the Committee's winter session.
Under the circumstances, the preparation of that budget will also suffer from a lack of operational experience.
In this connection, the Committee draws attention to what is stated in paragraph 21 above and to the provisions of General Assembly resolution 49/233 A of 23 December 1994.”
During the Advisory Committee's consideration of the proposed UNMIK budget for 2000-2001, representatives of the Secretary-General informed the Committee that the situation in the mission area was still in a state of rapid and significant change and that that had an impact on the structure and requirements of UNMIK.
The Advisory Committee recommends that requirements for UNMIK be re-examined in September 2000.
Taking into account the need for additional funding prior to the review of proposals for UNMIK in early autumn of 2000, the Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly authorize commitment with assessment of $220 million gross to allow UNMIK to continue its activities through 31 December 2000.
The Committee also recommends, however, that this funding be granted without prejudice to recommendations that the Committee might make to the Assembly in the autumn of 2000 and the decisions that the Assembly might take thereon with regard to the budgetary and administrative matters, including posts, concerning UNMIK.
In this connection and in order to avoid disruption, in the conduct of UNMIK operations, the Committee recommends that there be authority to enter into contractual arrangements for staff for up to one year.
The Committee points out that, should it be necessary, staff employed against posts which are eventually not approved can be accommodated against vacancies until the expiry of their contracts.
Although it should be borne in mind that the staffing table has not yet been approved, the Advisory Committee recommends further that the Secretary-General be allowed to proceed with the redeployment of posts among the various offices of the Mission.
Moreover, in recruiting staff (for periods of up to one year) the Committee is of the opinion that priority should be given to the selection of additional language assistants commensurate with the deployment of civilian police.

* Reissued for technical reasons.
Report of the Secretary-General
I. Introduction
This report is submitted in accordance with section E of General Assembly resolution 54/248 of 23 December 1999, in which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to report on the measures taken pursuant to the requests made therein by the end of April 2000 and decided to revert to the matter during its resumed fifty-fourth session.
The measures in question refer to the equal treatment of the six official languages in the development and enhancement of the United Nations web sites, in the formalization of the structure of the Information Technology Section of the Department of Public Information, and in the improvement and updating of document access and retrieval from the United Nations web sites and from the optical disk system, at all duty stations.
They also include the improvement of access to the web page of the Procurement Division, Office of Central Support Services, Department of Management.
Web sites and related issues
The major issues concerning the multilingual development of the United Nations web site are addressed in a report of the Secretary-General which has been prepared at the request of the General Assembly (resolution 54/82 B of 6 December 1999) for consideration by the Committee on Information at its twenty-second session, from 1 to 12 May 2000.
This report will also be submitted to the Committee on Conferences at its substantive session of 2000.
It has been issued under the symbol A/AC.198/2000/7-A/AC.172/2000/4 and is being made available to the General Assembly and the Fifth Committee at this time.
The conversion by the General Assembly, under resolution 54/249 of 23 December 1999, of three Professional posts in the Department of Public Information relating to web sites in Arabic, Chinese and Russian from general temporary assistance to regular budget posts was the first official allocation of resources to web site activity in the Department.
Steps are now under way to formalize the recruitment to fill these posts.
With the completion of this process, there will be one Professional-level web site coordinator for the management and coordination of the web site in each of the official languages.
Though this will not resolve the issue of parity treatment for the languages, it is a first step towards achieving that objective.
The web site is a channel for the distribution of content, much like a radio or a television set or the pages of a newspaper.
Creation of content for each of these media channels requires specific focus.
The fundamental issue of content creation on an equal basis in the six languages will need to be revisited with a view to deciding on policy issues regarding the rendering of non-parliamentary and public information material into all official languages.
Requiring parity in the official languages on the web site will also require that the concept of working languages in the Secretariat be reviewed.
Once the primary materials are created in all languages, it would be relatively less expensive to make them available on the web site.
As requested by the General Assembly, the web page of the Procurement Division has been given more visibility by including links to it from the relevant areas of the main United Nations web site.
Access to the page is now available from the following convenient and logical entry points on the main United Nations site: (a) under the Business/Civil Society button from the main page; (b) through the Site Index, listed alphabetically, under “P”; and (c) under the General Information button.
Optical disk system
Since its establishment as the electronic repository of United Nations documents, the optical disk system has ensured simultaneous retrieval in the six official languages.
Documents have always been equally available in all languages for on-screen display and printing, regardless of the text-processing software with which they had been created.
In the past, however, there were disparities between languages when users wished to open and cut-and-paste documents.
Those disparities, which were partially a consequence of lags in the development of software for some languages by the computer industry, affected the Arabic and Russian versions.
They have now been eliminated.
Until recently, Arabic and Russian documents were processed in WordPerfect 5.1, an antiquated software which lately has not been widely available among outside users, who have been working with more advanced software. This incompatibility made it impossible for those users to open and cut-and-paste documents retrieved in these two languages.
All the language units of the Text-Processing Section are now fully equipped to operate with MS Word 97 (MS Word 2000 in the Chinese Unit).
Updated macros have been developed and staff training is about to be completed.
During the period from 1 to 20 April, 86 per cent of the new documents were produced in MS Word for the six languages combined.
The frequency of use of MS Word is increasing daily and full production in MS Word of all new documents in all languages will be achieved during the next few weeks.
In addition to facilitating retrieval, bringing all languages to the same level of technological advancement will allow for easier conversion of all language versions of documents to other formats, namely PDF and HTML.
Furthermore, the optical disk system is being re-engineered to operate on a more current technology based on magnetic disks — rather than optical platters — and Notes Domino.
The implementation of this new system, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2000, will provide concurrent access to a much higher number of users than at present.

Agenda item 149
Financing of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic
Financing of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic
Report of the Secretary-General
Contents
By its resolution 1271 (1999) of 22 October 1999, the Security Council extended the mandate of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA) until 15 February 2000, with a view to ensuring a short and gradual transition from United Nations peacekeeping involvement in the Central African Republic to a post-conflict peace-building presence.
The present report contains the revised budget for the maintenance and liquidation of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA) for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000, which amounts to $41,098,075 gross ($40,069,275 net), excluding voluntary contributions in kind of $736,300, as well as the projected requirements for the continuation of liquidation activities thereafter at United Nations Headquarters in New York estimated at $115,800 gross ($102,800 net).
It should be read in conjunction with the original budget of the Mission for the 1999-2000 financial period contained in the report of the Secretary-General dated 5 May 1999 (A/53/939), which contains, inter alia, information on the Mission's political mandate, operational requirements, voluntary contributions and trust funds, troop contributors, contingent-owned equipment and self-sustainment arrangements and mission-specific costs and ratios.
Accordingly, the present report provides information only on parameters that have changed since the original budget submission.
Based on the recommendation contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions dated 21 May 1999 (A/53/971), the General Assembly, in its resolution 53/238 of 8 June 1999, appropriated an amount of $33,367,875 gross ($32,572,675 net) for the maintenance of MINURCA for the period from 1 July to 15 November 1999 and its subsequent liquidation (Security Council resolution 1230 (1999) of 26 February 1999), inclusive of an amount of $1,659,640 for the support account for peacekeeping operations and $325,435 for the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi.
The revised budget for MINURCA for the 1999-2000 financial period is inclusive of the commitment authority granted by the Advisory Committee in the amount of $6,701,900 for the support of the conduct of the presidential elections (see para.
6 below) and represents an increase of 23 per cent in gross terms ($7,730,200) compared with the appropriation provided by the General Assembly for the same period.
a Information on the distribution of resources by standard and mission-specific costs is contained in annex II B.
b Based on appropriation provided in General Assembly resolution 53/238.
c Represents logistical support ($132,300) and military-pattern equipment ($604,000).
d Not applicable.
a Repatriated on 11 March 2000.
While for reasons indicated in paragraph 25 of the Mission's financing report dated 5 May 1999 (A/53/939) the budget did not include requirements associated with the supportive role that MINURCA had been authorized to play in the conduct of the presidential elections (Security Council resolution 1230 (1999)), resources amounting to $6,701,900 were subsequently provided for this purpose in commitment authority granted by the Advisory Committee in a letter dated 14 July 1999 from its Chairman addressed to the Secretary-General.
Based on the concept of operations set out in detail in paragraphs 16 through 28 of the sixth report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council on MINURCA dated 28 May 1999 (S/1999/621), electoral support provided by MINURCA for the conduct of presidential elections held in the Central African Republic on 19 September 1999 involved deployment throughout the country of short- and medium-term observers, essential military personnel and equipment, as well as delivery and retrieval of electoral materials.
Subsequently, pursuant to Security Council resolution 1271 (1999), by which the Council decided to extend the mandate of MINURCA until 15 February 2000 with a view to ensuring a short and gradual transition from United Nations peacekeeping involvement in the Central African Republic to a post-conflict peace-building presence, the Mission's operational plan provided for the phased repatriation by mid-March 2000 of military contingents and drawdown of civilian personnel, shipment of the contingent-owned equipment and disposition of the United Nations-owned assets, with a view to the completion of liquidation activities in situ by 30 April 2000, followed by a short liquidation period at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
Status of reimbursement of troop-contributing Governments
Full reimbursement in accordance with the standard rates established by the General Assembly for troop costs has been made to troop contributors through 31 December 1999.
With repatriation of troops completed on 11 March 2000, an estimated amount of $1,029,300 remains due for troop costs for the January-March 2000 period.
Revised staffing requirements
The proposed staffing establishment shown below reflects revised requirements of MINURCA for the 1999-2000 financial period in connection with the extension of the Mission's mandate, continuation of the liquidation activities in situ until 30 April 2000 and the completion of residual liquidation activities at United Nations Headquarters in New York thereafter, including six work-months for the 2000-2001 financial period.
(Table for offset) V. Action to be taken by the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session
The action to be taken by the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session in connection with the financing of MINURCA is the following:
(a) To appropriate and assess the additional amount of $7,730,200 gross ($7,496,600 net), for the Mission for the 12-month period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000, inclusive of the commitment authority of $6,701,900 granted by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;
(b) To appropriate and assess the amount of $115,800 gross ($102,800 net) for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001.

C. Supplementary information
Military personnel costs
Apportionment: $14,785,700; Revised estimate: $17,952,200; Variance: $3,166,500
The net increase of $3,166,500 under this heading is attributable to the extension of the Mission's mandate until 15 February 2000 and the resulting additional requirements under military contingents ($1,675,900), contingent-owned equipment and self-sustainment ($1,709,000), partially offset by reduced requirement under death and disability compensation ($218,400) budget line item (see para.
Military contingents
While the budgetary provision assumed withdrawal of military personnel by 15 November 1999, with a small contingent remaining in the mission area until 15 January 2000 to provide security during the liquidation period, repatriation of contingents had been delayed pursuant to Security Council resolution 1271 (1999).
The net increase of $1,675,900 under the above heading is attributable to the retention of contingent personnel in the mission area until mid-March 2000, resulting in additional requirements for troop reimbursement costs ($2,137,200), daily allowance ($78,500), mission subsistence allowance ($173,500) and clothing and equipment allowance ($156,600).
Reduced requirements for the repatriation of troops ($772,400), rations ($6,800) and welfare ($90,700) take into account projected expenditures under these budget line items and are based on actual arrangements made by the Mission with contractors and air carriers.
The revised deployment schedule of military personnel is shown below:
a Repatriated on 11 March 2000.
Other costs pertaining to military personnel
The net increase of $1,490,600 under this heading is due to additional requirements under contingent-owned equipment ($1,315,700) and self-sustainment ($393,300), which are based on the memoranda of understanding concluded with the Governments of troop-contributing countries.
Increased requirements are partially offset by a cancellation of a provision for death and disability compensation payments ($218,400) as no incidents resulting in death or injury to MINURCA's military personnel have been reported during the period under review.
Apportionment: $8,408,200; Revised estimate: $10,002,100; Variance: $1,593,900
The increase of $1,593,900 under the above heading is attributable to additional requirements under civilian police costs ($155,400), international and local staff ($347,300), United Nations Volunteers ($542,700) and civilian electoral observers ($548,500).
The increase of $155,400 under the above heading is attributable to the extension of MINURCA's mandate and the retention of civilian police advisers in the mission area, resulting in additional requirements under mission subsistence allowance and clothing and equipment allowance, partially offset by reduced requirements under travel costs.
The revised deployment schedule of civilian police is shown in table 2 of the present report.
International and local staff
The net increase of $347,300 under the above heading is attributable to the extension of the Mission's mandate and the consequential retention of international and local staff in the mission area beyond the deadlines envisaged in the original budget.
Provision for the international staff salary costs reflects the actual incumbency situation, with 70 per cent of staff classified as mission appointees, and includes estimated requirements to cover unutilized annual leave and leave commutation entitlements, while local staff salaries are based on the G-3, step III level of the applicable salary scale.
Additional provisions under international and local staff salaries, consultants and mission subsistence allowance are partially offset by reduced requirements under common staff costs, general temporary assistance, overtime and other official travel, based on the actual costs incurred through February 2000 and projections for the remaining four months of the 1999-2000 period.
With regard to the 2000/2001 financial period, the revised cost estimate provides for six work-months of international staff for the completion of residual liquidation tasks at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
Liquidation activities at Headquarters will be headed by the Mission's Chief Finance Officer, assisted by two locally recruited New York-based Finance Assistants at the General Service (other) level.
The revised deployment schedule of international and local staff is shown in table 2 of the present report.
United Nations Volunteers
The increase of $542,700 under the above heading is attributable to the deployment of the additional 26 United Nations Volunteers serving as electoral observers during presidential elections for a total of 148 work-months compared with the budgetary provision for 59 work-months for the period from 1 July to 15 November 1999.
Civilian electoral observers
Provision of $548,500 is made to cover estimated expenditure incurred for the deployment of 200 short-term civilian electoral observers (100 recruited locally and 100 recruited from United Nations Headquarters and other United Nations offices, predominantly Africa and Europe), including round-trip travel and daily subsistence allowance.
Operational requirements
Apportionment: $7,292,900; Revised estimate: $9,850,600; Variance: $2,557,700
The net increase of $2,557,700 under this heading is attributable to additional requirements under air operations ($2,683,800), communications ($94,100), and air and surface freight ($545,500), partially offset by reduced requirements under premises/accommodation ($66,500), infrastructure repairs ($5,300), transport operations ($103,300), other equipment ($70,300) and supplies and services ($519,400).
Premises/accommodation
Reduced provision of $1,092,500 under the above heading reflects a net decrease of $66,500 and takes into account the actual pattern of expenditures through February 2000 and anticipated requirements for the remaining four months of the 1999-2000 period based on contractual arrangements with local vendors and suppliers and duration of leases of office and accommodation space.
Reduced requirements for the alterations and renovation of premises, maintenance supplies, services and utilities are partially offset by additional requirements for the rental of premises owing to a provision for the restoration of rented premises to the original configuration prior to their return to lessors, as well as to the unforeseen actual expenditure under construction of prefabricated building.
Transport operations
Reduced provision of $445,700 under the above heading reflects a net decrease of $103,300 based on the actual pattern of expenditures during the reporting period and is attributable to lower than anticipated requirements under rental of vehicles, spare parts, repairs and maintenance and petrol, oil and lubricants, partially offset by additional requirements under vehicle insurance.
As all of the Mission's serviceable vehicles have been transferred to other missions, provision of $73,400 made in the original budget for the refurbishment of vehicles at the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi is no longer required.
Air operations
As was indicated in paragraph 25 of the Mission's financing report dated 5 May 1999 (A/53/939), the original budget did not include requirements associated with the supportive role that MINURCA had been authorized to play in the conduct of presidential elections.
While the approved configuration of MINURCA's aircraft fleet remained essentially unchanged, during the period from August to October 1999 the fleet had been augmented by an additional six medium utility helicopters, including three with extended flight range capability, three medium and one heavy passenger/cargo fixed-wing aircraft (see annex II A for details).
Revised provisions of $1,688,500 and $2,504,700 for the helicopter operations and fixed-wing aircraft reflect increases of $1,172,600 and $1,615,200 under the respective budget line items attributable to the deployment of additional aircraft as detailed in annex II A to the present report.
Provision for the aviation fuel and lubricants is based on the actual consumption and expenditure reports.
Provision for aircrew subsistence allowance is reduced by $153,000, reflecting actual costs incurred on accommodation and meals during overnight stay of crews outside of Bangui, while additional provision of $49,000 under other air operations reflects estimated requirements for fixed-wing aircraft navigation fees.
Revised provision of $426,900 under the above heading reflects a net increase of $94,100 attributable to the extension of the Mission's mandate, followed by liquidation activities in the mission area through 30 April 2000.
It is based on the existing contractual arrangements for the transponder lease as well as on the projected requirements to cover the cost of communication services rendered by local providers, partially offset by reduced requirements under spare parts, repairs and maintenance based on the actual pattern of expenditures and reduced requirements for the refurbishment of equipment at the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi.
Other equipment
Revised provision of $101,900 under the above heading reflects a net decrease of $70,300 attributable to reduced requirements under spare parts, repairs and maintenance of equipment based on the actual consumption patterns and reduced requirements for the refurbishment of equipment at the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, which is partially offset by additional provision for the replacement of worn-out and damaged office furniture.
Supplies and services
Revised provision of $809,800 under this heading reflects a net decrease of $519,400 based on the actual expenditure patterns and consumption rates of supplies and materials through February 2000 and on the projected requirements for the two-month period ending 30 April 2000, resulting in reduced provisions under all budget line items except miscellaneous services.
With regard to miscellaneous services, increased provision is made to cover bank charges and losses on currency fluctuations.
With regard to the 2000-2001 financial period, provision of $29,600 is made for the liquidation audit of MINURCA by the Board of Auditors.
Air and surface freight
Revised provision of $2,585,400 under the above heading reflects an increase of $545,500 attributable to additional requirements for the repatriation of contingent-owned equipment ($1,030,700), which is partially offset by lower-than-budgeted requirements for commercial freight and cartage ($485,200).
Other programmes
Apportionment: $100,800; Revised estimate: $279,300; Variance: $178,500
The increase under the above heading is primarily attributable to additional requirements under public information programmes.
Staff assessment
Apportionment: $795,200; Revised estimate: $1,028,800; Variance: $233,600
The increase of $233,600 under this heading is attributable to the extension of the Mission's mandate and retention of international staff in the mission area beyond the originally projected deadlines.

Financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone

Financing of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financial performance of the United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL) for the period from its inception on 13 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 (A/54/778), as well as on the revised budget for the operation of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 and the proposed budget for the 12-month period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 (A/54/820).
During its consideration of the reports, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information.
By its resolution 1270 (1999) of 22 October 1999, the Security Council decided to establish UNAMSIL with immediate effect for an initial period of six months and also decided that the military component of the Mission should comprise a maximum of 6,000 military personnel, including 260 military observers.
The Council further decided that UNAMSIL would take over the substantive civilian and military components and functions of UNOMSIL and that the mandate of UNOMSIL should terminate immediately on the establishment of UNAMSIL.
Financial performance for the period from 13 July 1998 to 30 June 1999
By its resolution 53/29 of 20 November 1998, the General Assembly appropriated an amount of $22 million gross ($21,279,800 net) for the establishment and operation of UNOMSIL for the period from 13 July 1998 to 30 June 1999.
Of that appropriation, $16,167,100 gross ($15,706,550 net) has been assessed on Member States.
Expenditures for the period totalled $12,883,800 gross ($12,397,000 net), resulting in an unutilized balance of appropriation of $9,116,200 gross ($8,882,800 net), or approximately 48 per cent of the appropriation, and an unutilized balance of assessments of $3,283,300 gross ($3,309,550 net).
The unutilized balances were attributable to the overall scaling back of operations of UNOMSIL as a consequence of the outbreak of hostilities in Freetown in mid-December 1998 and early January 1999, leading to the evacuation of UNOMSIL to Conakry, and the subsequent downsizing of the Mission's military and civilian components.
As indicated in paragraph 8 of the report of the Secretary-General on the financial performance of UNOMSIL (A/54/778), the evacuation of the Mission to Guinea was completed in early January 1999 and was accompanied by the repatriation of 47 military personnel, with only 8 observers remaining, and of all police advisers.
The international civilian component was also downsized to 25 personnel, with only 8 local staff retained from the authorized strength of 48 personnel, a reduction of 47 and 83 per cent respectively.
The Advisory Committee was informed that in respect of death and disability compensation, unliquidated obligations as at 24 March 2000 amounted to $829,000 and that the cash position of UNOMSIL as at 24 March 2000 was $35.6 million, with unliquidated obligations for the period from 13 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 amounting to $400,400.
The Advisory Committee was also informed that the total amount assessed on Member States for the period from 13 July 1998 to 30 June 2000 for UNOMSIL and UNAMSIL was $215.3 million, against which payments received as at 15 March 2000 amounted to $71.0 million, leaving an outstanding balance of $144.3 million.
The actions to be taken by the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session in connection with the financing of UNOMSIL for the period from 13 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 were set out in paragraph 14 of the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the Mission (A/54/778).
The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the Secretary-General's proposal to reduce the appropriation provided in General Assembly resolution 53/29 for the establishment and operation of the Observer Mission for the period from 13 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 from $22 million gross ($21,279,800 net) to $16,167,100 gross ($15,706,550 net), corresponding to the amount actually assessed on Member States.
The Committee also recommends that the unutilized balance of $3,283,300 gross ($3,309,500 net), based on the reduced appropriation recommended above, be credited to Member States in a manner to be decided by the General Assembly.
Revised estimates for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 and estimates for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001
The report of the Secretary-General containing revised estimates for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 and estimates for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 (A/54/820) was submitted pursuant to Security Council resolution 1289 (2000) of 7 February 2000.
By that resolution, the Council decided to expand the military component of UNAMSIL from 5,100 to a maximum of 11,100 military personnel and revised the mandate of the Mission to include the following additional tasks: (a) to provide security at key locations and government buildings, in particular in Freetown, important intersections and major airports, including Lungi airport; (b) to facilitate the free flow of people, goods and humanitarian assistance along specified thoroughfares; (c) to provide security in and at all sites of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme; (d) to coordinate with and assist, in common areas of deployment, the Sierra Leone law enforcement authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities; and (e) to guard weapons, ammunition and other military equipment collected from ex-combatants and to assist in their subsequent disposal or destruction.
As indicated in paragraph 1 of the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of UNAMSIL, an amount of $265,789,000 gross ($264,371,600 net) has been requested for the revised budget of the Mission for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000.
The revised estimates represent an increase of 32.9 per cent ($65,789,000) in gross terms in comparison with the resources apportioned by the General Assembly for the period.
The proposal reflects increases of 30.3 per cent ($34,092,500) in military personnel costs, 56.7 per cent ($36,855,300) in operational requirements and 415.1 per cent ($773,300) in other programmes and reductions of 25.3 per cent ($5,114,600) in civilian personnel costs and 36.6 per cent ($817,500) in staff assessment.
As indicated in paragraph 4 of the same report, an amount of $476,726,400 gross ($472,965,600 net) has been requested for the maintenance of UNAMSIL for the 12-month period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001.
The proposed budget represents an increase of 79.4 per cent ($210,937,400) in gross terms over the revised budget for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000.
The proposal reflects increases of 141.3 per cent ($207,046,900) in military personnel costs, 132.7 per cent ($20,000,100) in civilian personnel costs and 165.3 per cent ($2,343,400) in staff assessment and reductions of 17.5 per cent ($17,840,300) in operational requirements and 63.8 per cent ($612,700) in other programmes.
In examining the budget proposals, the Advisory Committee took into account additional information provided orally and in writing by the representatives of the Secretary-General, as well as the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council of 7 March 2000 (S/2000/186).
In that report, the Secretary-General concluded that it was clear that much remained to be done to further the peace process in Sierra Leone and that significant material and financial resources would be required to achieve the objectives of the peace process (S/2000/186, para.
The Advisory Committee was informed that the increases in the revised budget of UNAMSIL for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 and the proposed budget of the Mission for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 were mainly due to the almost twofold expansion of the military component of the Mission, as well as to its expanded mandate.
The Committee was informed that, as at 24 March 2000, 7,186 military contingent personnel, out of an authorized 10,840, and 259 military observers, out of an authorized 260, were already in theatre.
Upon inquiry, the Committee was informed that the remaining military contingent personnel were expected to be deployed by the end of April 2000.
With respect to civil personnel, the Advisory Committee was informed that, against the authorized staffing establishment of UNAMSIL of 60 civilian police, 228 international staff, 282 local staff and 72 United Nations Volunteers, the posts encumbered as at 24 March 2000 were 6 civilian police, 149 international staff, 63 local staff and 62 United Nations Volunteers.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that 25 civilian police and 38 international staff were currently en route to the Mission and that the deployment of civilian police and international staff had been delayed in large part because of a lack of accommodations.
The Advisory Committee notes that the proposed increase in the Mission's support staff consists of 17 international staff (5 P-5, 5 P-4, 3 P-3 and 7 Field Service posts, offset by the reduction of 2 P-2 and 1 General Service (Other level) posts), 24 local staff and 7 United Nations Volunteers, for a total increase of 48 support staff.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the increase in support staff would be kept to a minimum by the contracting-out of a number of logistics/movement services.
The Committee was informed that the Mission's current service contracts included a contract of $48,000 for security services and a contract of $6,520,867 for logistical support services.
The Committee was also informed that contracts for cleaning services and garbage and sewage removal were currently under review by the Mission.
In the opinion of the Committee, the proposed increase in support staff by 48 is modest given the near doubling of the military personnel of the Mission.
The Committee notes the efforts made by the Mission to keep support staff increases to a minimum and welcomes the use of outsourcing as a means to achieve that goal.
The Committee requests that the cost-effectiveness of these measures be monitored in the light of the operational needs of the Mission.
The Advisory Committee requested additional information on demining and the activities of the Mine Action Unit.
The Committee was informed that a mine action technical assessment team, which visited Sierra Leone from 30 January to 6 February 2000, had determined that the problem posed by landmines and unexploded ordnance was limited in extent and could be dealt with effectively by the UNAMSIL Mine Action Unit.
With regard to the activities of the Unit, the Committee was informed that the Unit would coordinate mine action within Sierra Leone, in particular the survey, detection and clearance of mines and unexploded ordnance, and would conduct mine awareness training for UNAMSIL personnel.
The proposed staffing for the Mine Action Unit includes one P-3 Liaison/Planning Officer (Chief of Unit) and one local staff, assisted by six military personnel.
The Committee was informed that equipment for the Unit (electronic data-processing equipment, vehicles and office furniture and equipment) would be provided from the UNAMSIL budget, with special safety equipment budgeted separately under mine-clearing programmes.
It was confirmed to the Committee that the Mine Action Unit is funded entirely from the assessed budget.
In paragraphs 23 to 26 and 45 to 47 of his report to the Security Council (S/2000/186), the Secretary-General provided information on the status of the programme on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants.
However, neither the information in the above report nor that contained in the budget document (A/54/820) gives a clear picture of the organization, planning and funding of the programme.
Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme was designed, conducted and financed by the Government of Sierra Leone, which received major financial support from the World Bank
through the Multi-donor Trust Fund managed by the Bank.
The Committee was also informed that the contribution of the United Nations to the programme was limited to the provision of security by armed troops, the registration of ex-combatants by military observers and the destruction of weapons and that those activities were financed through assessed contributions.
The Committee was further informed that the financing of small-scale projects to support local activities in the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration camps through voluntary contributions from the United Nations Trust Fund for Sierra Leone was envisaged.
Upon request, the Advisory Committee was provided with estimates of the total requirements for the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme in United States dollars, as follows:
The Advisory Committee notes the comments by the Secretary-General that the implementation of the programme continued at a rather slow pace and that there was a clear need for all stakeholders to agree on a realistic target date for the completion of the disarmament and demobilization of all ex-combatants (S/2000/186, paras.
23 and 45). In view of the critical role that programme has in the peace process and of the magnitude of the resources involved, the Advisory Committee stresses the importance of adequate and timely funding of all the related activities by the parties concerned.
On the basis of the information provided, the Committee emphasizes the importance of effective coordination amongst the various entities in the operational area.
The Committee also requests that a coordinated monitoring and evaluation programme be put in place to ensure successful and efficient completion of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme.
The actions to be taken by the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session in connection with the financing of UNAMSIL were set out in paragraph 4 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/54/820).
In view of its comments in the paragraphs above, the Advisory Committee recommends approval of the Secretary-General's request for the appropriation and assessment of the additional amount of $65,789,000 gross ($66,606,500 net) for the maintenance of UNAMSIL for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000.
The Committee also recommends approval of the appropriation and assessment of the amount of $476,726,400 gross ($472,965,600 net) for the maintenance of the Mission for the 12-month period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001.
Fifty fourth session
Agenda item 151 (a)
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the review of the rates of reimbursement to the Governments of troop-contributing States (A/54/763).
During its consideration of the report, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information and clarifications.
By its resolution 51/218 E of 17 June 1997, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to carry out a new survey of troop-contributing States, as suggested in paragraph 12 of the report of the Advisory Committee of 6 August 1996 (A/50/1012).
For the purpose of the survey, cost information based on military salary scales in effect as of December 1996 was requested from the 64 Member States providing troops and military observers to United Nations peacekeeping operations at that time.
Of the remaining 31 States, 26 were providing troops in December 1996, and 6 of those were also providing military observers.
The remaining five States were providing military observers only.
As indicated in paragraphs 18 to 21 of the report of the Secretary-General, the average of the costs reported by the 26 troop-contributing Member States for pay and allowances in December 1996 ranged between $774 and $10,778 per person per month, with an overall average of $3,806 and a median of $2,812.
In comparison, the previous survey, carried out in 1991, comprising replies from 17 States, indicated an overall average cost of $3,611 and a median of $3,560.
The 1996 survey showed that the average cost per person per month of the usage factor for personal clothing, gear and equipment, and personal weaponry (including ammunition) issued by the troop-contributing States to their personnel ranged from $110 to $966, with an overall average cost of $490 and a median cost of $418, whereas the 1991 survey indicated an overall average cost of $213 and a median cost of $195.
As indicated in paragraph 22 of the report, the cost information from the 11 States providing military personnel other than troops showed that the average total cost incurred by those States for the provision of such personnel amounted to $6,355 per person per month, with a median cost of $5,637 per person per month.
The results of the review show an average overall absorption factor for 1996 of 53.9 per cent, reflecting an increase of 21.1 per cent over the average absorption factor of 32.8 per cent reported for 1991.
The General Assembly may wish to take into consideration the increase since 1991 in the average overall absorption factor and to decide whether an adjustment to the current standard rates of reimbursement for troops is warranted.
In paragraph 8 of its report of 6 August 1996 (A/50/1012), the Advisory Committee requested the Secretariat to undertake a complete analysis of all services being provided to troops, together with an indication of the rationale for the provision of each service and how those services are administered and accounted for.
The Committee expected that all costs assumed by the Organization vis-à-vis the troops would be taken into account in that analysis.
However, in the present analysis, some expenses of the Organization, such as direct payments to military personnel of $1.28 per day per member of a contingent and a leave allowance of $10.50 per day per member of a contingent for up to seven days, have not been reflected.
The results of the analysis would also have been significantly affected if an approximation of the average cost of services provided by the United Nations peacekeeping missions per member of a contingent had been included.
The Committee is of the opinion that it would be appropriate to adjust the current methodology of calculating the standard rates of reimbursement to include the direct payments to military personnel mentioned above.
Furthermore, there is a strong argument in favour of deducting those amounts from the reimbursements to troop-contributing States.
The Committee also points out that there appear to be a number of inconsistencies in the data provided by troop-contributing States, making a comparative analysis difficult.
The Advisory Committee points out that the data collected for the purposes of the review relate to a situation that obtained in December 1996, almost three and one half years ago.
The level of response by troop-contributing States to the 1996 survey was relatively low.
Furthermore, the number of troop-contributing States has increased from 64 in 1996 to 83 in 2000.
The Committee invites the General Assembly in future to provide further guidelines with a view to refining the methodology to ensure that more timely and comprehensive data is provided to establish whether a change in the standard rates of reimbursement to troop-contributing States is warranted.

Financing of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financial performance of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA) for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 (A/54/851) and the revised budget of MINURCA for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 (A/54/857).
During its consideration of the reports, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information.
Financial performance report for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999
By its resolutions 52/249 of 26 June 1998 and 53/238 of 8 June 1999, the General Assembly appropriated a total amount of $63,415,650 gross ($62,230,050 net) for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999, excluding voluntary contributions in kind of $2,863,300.
As indicated in table 1 and annexes I and II of the report of the Secretary-General in document A/54/851, expenditure for the same period amounted to $60,221,750 gross ($58,991,500 net), resulting in an unencumbered balance of $3,193,900 gross ($3,238,550 net).
The unencumbered balance was attributable primarily to the lower deployment levels of military personnel ($542,700) and civilian personnel ($1,240,800) and reduced operational requirements under premises/accommodation ($333,300), air operations ($1,051,900) and other equipment ($285,700).
With regard to the status of reimbursement of troop-contributing Member States, the Committee was informed that troop costs in the amount of $28.6 million had been reimbursed up to 31 December 1999, while the amount owed was $1.0 million for the period from 1 January to 11 March 2000.
With regard to reimbursement for contingent-owned equipment, the amount of $96,300 had been reimbursed as at 30 April 2000, the estimated amount owed was $10.0 million as at 31 March 2000 and unliquidated obligations for contingent-owned equipment amounted to $7.9 million.
For death and disability compensation, two claims paid amounted to $100,000 and unliquidated claims for one pending claim amounted to $596,100, as at 30 April 2000.
The Committee was informed that as at 1 May 2000, the cash position amounted to $5.9 million and current loans amounted to $17.2 million.
As at 15 April 2000, assessments amounted to $113.8 million, payments received totalled $77.2 million and amounts outstanding were at $36.6 million.
Total unliquidated obligations for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 were $9.2 million as at 30 April 2000.
The action to be taken by the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session in connection with the financing of MINURCA is to decide on the treatment of the unencumbered balance of $3,193,900 gross ($3,238,500 net) for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999.
The Committee recommends that the unencumbered balance of $3,193,900 gross ($3,238,500 net) for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 be credited to Member States in a manner to be decided by the General Assembly.
Revised budget of MINURCA for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000
As indicated in paragraph 2 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/54/857), the revised budget for MINURCA for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 amounts to $41,098,075 gross ($40,069,275 net), excluding voluntary contributions in kind of $736,300 and representing an increase of 23 per cent ($7,730,200 gross), when compared with the original budget for the same period and reflects the absorption of the commitment authority of $6,701,900 granted by the Advisory Committee (see para.
9 below). By its resolution 53/238 of 8 June 1999, the General Assembly appropriated an amount of $33,367,875 gross ($32,572,675 net) for the maintenance of MINURCA for the period from 1 July to 15 November 1999 and its subsequent liquidation, inclusive of an amount of $1,659,640 for the support account for peacekeeping operations and $325,435 for the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi.
In a letter dated 14 July 1999 from the Chairman of the Advisory Committee to the Secretary-General, the Advisory Committee concurred with the request of the Secretary-General to enter into commitments in an amount not exceeding $6,701,900 in order to meet the estimated additional cost of MINURCA's support for the conduct of presidential elections in the Central African Republic.
The Security Council, by its resolution 1271 (1999) of 22 October 1999, extended the mandate of MINURCA until 15 February 2000.
The Committee notes from paragraph 2 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/54/857) that projected requirements for the continuation of liquidation activities at the United Nations Headquarters in New York for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 are estimated at $115,800 gross ($102,800 net).
The action to be taken by the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session in connection with the financing of MINURCA are set out in paragraph 11 of the report of the Secretary-General in document A/54/857.
The Committee recommends that the General Assembly appropriate and assess the additional amount of $7,730,200 gross ($7,496,600 net), for the Mission for the 12-month period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000, inclusive of the commitment authority of $6,701,900 granted by the Advisory Committee.
The Committee also recommends that the General Assembly appropriate the amount of $115,800 gross ($102,800 net) for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001.
In view of the financial data contained in paragraphs 4 and 5 above, the Committee is of the opinion that an assessment in this case is not necessary at this stage.

Agenda item 129
Financing of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission and the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola
Measures taken to improve procurement activities in the field
Report of the Secretary-General
I. Introduction
As a result of the findings and recommendations of the Office of Internal Oversight Services on the audits of the procurement process in the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM) (A/52/881, annex), the General Assembly, in its resolution 54/17, requested the Secretary-General to provide additional information on the measures being taken by the Secretariat to further improve procurement activities in the field and to enhance control and accountability, within the context of the report on management irregularities causing financial losses to the Organization, as requested by the Assembly in its resolution 53/225.
The Assembly also requested the Secretary-General to submit to it a report prior to the second part of its resumed fifty-fourth session providing a concrete plan to correct procurement-related problems in peacekeeping operations, which should include the following: (a) all remedial measures taken to address problems identified with regard to the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola and other peacekeeping operations; (b) standardization of the corrective measures that have already been taken for all existing and future peacekeeping operations; and (c) a description of how accountability was pursued in the cases of individuals who were found to have engaged in fraud, mismanagement or abuse, and how accountability measures will be applied in the future.
These interrelated aspects are being addressed jointly below.
General observations
In its report on the procurement audits in Angola (A/52/881, annex), the Office of Internal Oversight Services raised serious concerns about management deficiencies in the procurement process of UNAVEM.
As a result, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to address the issues raised by the report with regard to weaknesses in the procurement process in Angola.
In his comprehensive response (A/53/1018), the Secretary-General stressed that the audit findings had received full attention at Headquarters and at the field level, and that action had been taken to remedy the weaknesses identified by the Office of Internal Oversight Services.
This included measures for strengthening compliance with procurement procedures, the reorganization of the UNAVEM Procurement Section in 1996 and the assignment of experienced personnel to key positions.
The Secretary-General noted that although no evidence of fraud or financial loss had been detected in Angola, weaknesses in the procurement process must be addressed decisively.
Of particular concern in that context was the $6.9 million procurement of quartering area equipment by UNAVEM.
This case was included among the findings of the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services, but subsequently became the subject of a separate investigation by the Office (see A/54/548).
The Secretariat worked closely with the Office to ensure that responsibility for any misconduct or financial loss would be clearly assigned and pursued.
In the end, the investigation found no evidence of fraud or financial loss.
While disciplinary proceedings were therefore not required, the report identified weaknesses in the procurement of those goods and provided useful recommendations for improvement, which were endorsed by the Secretariat.
Strengthening of Field Procurement
Procurement in peacekeeping operations is characterized by the urgency and volume of goods required to support the rapid deployment of a large number of military and civilian personnel to a difficult environment.
The outcome was described in the reports of the Secretary-General on the implementation of procurement reform in the Secretariat (A/C.5/49/67 and A/C.5/50/13).
Since then, additional reports on the strengthening of field procurement have been submitted to the General Assembly (A/C.5/50/13/Rev.1, A/C.5/51/9, A/52/534 and Corr.1, and A/53/271 and Corr.1).
Reform measures implemented during this period include the introduction of procurement planning on the basis of the annual budget cycle, the initiation of preparatory processes in advance of commitment authority enhanced delegation of authority, and new arrangements governing contingent-owned equipment and self-sustainment that reduce the amount of direct support to be provided by the United Nations.
A particularly effective measure was the recent introduction of start-up kits for new missions as a first-line procurement support mechanism.
Under this arrangement, the most frequently used items are kept in reserve at the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, and are shipped as a package to missions during their inception or expansion.
The General Assembly, in its resolution 52/1 B of 26 June 1998, authorized the maintenance of two start-up kits.
The Secretariat has also tried to consolidate most of its generic requirements under systems contracts, both at Headquarters and in the field, including for rations, light vehicles and medium-sized vehicles, generators, communication and data-processing equipment and hard-wall containers, among other items.
The expanded use of systems contracts has led to reductions in procurement price and lead times, as well as in the number of ex post facto cases submitted to the Committee on Contracts.
In this context, the Secretariat is increasing the practice of sharing systems contracts with other United Nations agencies and programmes as part of the Secretary-General's initiative for the implementation of common services.
For example, the use of the World Food Programme's systems contract for furniture and stationery facilitated the start-up of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo.
As part of ongoing efforts to strengthen human resources, the Secretariat is currently designing a comprehensive procurement training programme that will target field procurement and contract administration personnel.
Classes are scheduled to commence in mid-May 2000.
Staff from the Field Administration and Logistics Division of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations are also deployed more frequently to missions at short notice during the start-up phase.
Among other benefits, their presence helps to establish the basis for a sound administrative structure from the beginning of the mission.
This approach is complemented by a system of rapid deployment of pre-selected personnel, using the expertise of all parts of the United Nations system and of the Member States, as described in the report of the Secretary-General on the support account for peacekeeping operations (A/54/800).
The sharp increase in the number and complexity of peacekeeping operations in the early 1990s caught the United Nations procurement system unprepared to meet the new challenges, in terms of both its organizational structure and its human resources capacity.
In addition, the expansion of peacekeeping operations was accompanied by an increase in the complexity of mandates, ranging from ceasefire monitoring and truce observation to the inclusion of electoral support, human rights monitoring, demobilization and civilian police training.
These factors, coupled with a procurement system designed in the early days of the Organization, contributed to the problems experienced in Angola.
While the audits and investigations did not reveal any severe misconduct in UNAVEM, as was originally feared, the Secretariat recognizes the importance of addressing procedural and systemic weaknesses in order to prevent any opportunity for misuse of United Nations resources.
Therefore, much has been done to make the procurement system more responsive to the requirements of peacekeeping operations and to ensure transparency and accountability at all stages of the process.
In the context of the current expansion of peacekeeping operations and the broadening of their mandates, the Secretariat must redouble its efforts to ensure that the noticeable improvements made in recent years are transformed into permanent gains.

Analysis of the organizational structure and the personnel and technical resources of the Non-Governmental Organizations Section of the United Nations Secretariat
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the analysis of the organizational structure and the personnel and technical resources of the Non-Governmental Organizations Section of the United Nations Secretariat (A/54/520/Add.1).
The report was submitted pursuant to resolution 54/249, paragraph 93, in which the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit a report to the Assembly at its fifty-fourth session on the administrative and financial issues concerning the Non-Governmental Organizations Section, in particular with regard to the number and level of posts in that Section.
The report is a supplement to the earlier report on the same subject which was submitted to the General Assembly in document A/54/520, describing in detail the activities of the Section and the significant increase in its workload and level of responsibility.
During the consideration of the report, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information.
As indicated in paragraphs 3 and 4 of document A/54/520/Add.1, the staffing resources of the Section funded from the regular budget include five Professional (one D-1, two P-4, one P-3 and one P-2) and four General Service posts, equivalent to approximately 108 work-months annually, of which 60 are at the Professional level and 48 at the General Service level.
In addition, the Section uses the services of volunteers on a regular basis, equivalent to approximately 60 work-months annually (20 work-months at the Professional level and 40 at the General Service level).
The Advisory Committee was informed that volunteers include United Nations interns, assigned to the Section but administered centrally by the Office of Human Resources Management, and volunteers from non-governmental organizations (NGOs), assisting in various administrative support activities.
In order to achieve a better balance between available and required staff resources and between permanent staff and volunteers, it is proposed to establish one new Professional post at the P-4 level and one General Service post.
The Advisory Committee is aware of both the level of responsibility of the NGO Section and its increased workload in the light of the current number of NGOs in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council.
The Committee has also noted that the number of meetings originally projected for the Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations, in the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001, has already doubled (A/54/657, para.
2). The Committee, therefore, does not have any objection to the proposed establishment of two additional posts (one P-4 and one General Service) in the Section.
However, in the light of the circumstances noted below, the Committee recommends that these two new posts be established on a temporary basis in the biennium 2000-2001 and that the proposal be resubmitted in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003.
The Advisory Committee recalls its views in paragraph 4 of its report in document A/54/657 that proposals to strengthen the capacity of the NGO Section had been procedurally mishandled by the Secretariat and that there was a lack of coordination between Secretariat units.
The Committee regrets the submission of proposals to strengthen the capacity of the NGO Section on a piecemeal basis.
The Advisory Committee reiterates its view, as indicated in paragraphs IV.10 and IV.11 of its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1998-1999,1 as approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 52/220, and as indicated again in paragraph IV.16 of its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001,2 that the Secretariat should submit a comprehensive report on the administrative and management implications of the large increase in NGOs involved in the work of the United Nations, in particular on the impact of this growth on the United Nations programme budget.
The report would allow the Committee to ascertain the extent to which optimum use is made of current resources as well as to evaluate such additional resources as may be proposed for the various units of the Secretariat working with NGOs.

I. Introduction and recommendations
The General Assembly, in its resolution 54/18 dated 29 October 1999, requested the Board of Auditors to undertake, as a matter of priority, a comprehensive audit of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) covering the question of the payment of mission subsistence allowance.
The Board of Auditors carried out this audit during February and March 2000 at United Nations Headquarters and at the Mission in Umm Qasr.
In August 1993, the Internal Audit Division (now part of the Office of Internal Oversight Services) identified erroneous payments of mission subsistence allowance made to civilian staff by UNIKOM, and recommended that the Mission conduct a review and recover all mission subsistence allowance overpayments.
The Mission did not implement the recommendation until August and September 1996, when it determined that the overpayment to international civilian staff totalled some $844,000.
The overpayment was subsequently revised by the Administration to $867,263.50.
In three General Assembly resolutions and decisions on the matter (51/440 of 16 December 1996, 51/234 of 13 June 1997 and 52/238 of 26 June 1998), the Secretary-General was requested to recover the amounts overpaid.
In its resolution 53/229 of 8 June 1999, the Assembly also requested the Secretary-General to submit a separate report on the overpayments, including the measures taken with respect to those responsible.
At the request of the Secretary-General, the Office of Internal Oversight Services, during February and May 1998, conducted a review of mission subsistence allowance overpayments by UNIKOM between 1991 and 1996.
The audit focused on the causes of the alleged overpayment, which was estimated by the Administration at $6,327,451.53, including $867,263.50 to international civilian staff and $5,460,188.03 to military observers.
The appeals of civilian staff members brought before the United Nations judicial bodies, including the Administrative Tribunal, complaints submitted by the individual military observers and communications received from the Governments concerned had challenged the grounds for recovery of irregular payments of mission subsistence allowance.
The Member States had specifically questioned the basis for extending to military observers policies and practices more appropriate for civilian personnel.
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions expressed concern that the amount of overpayment of mission subsistence allowance by UNIKOM had been revised several times in various reports of the Secretary-General.
The Administration had informed the Advisory Committee that in a number of instances information provided to the Committee in the past was not correct (A/54/418, para.
The Board's observations and conclusions were discussed with the Administration, whose views, where appropriate, have been reflected in the present report, which covers the administration and payment of mission subsistence allowance.
Other issues arising from the audit, including accounts receivable, non-expendable property and procurement, have been raised in a management letter addressed to the Administration and, to the extent that the Board considers it necessary, they will be reported on to the General Assembly in the report of the Board of Auditors on United Nations peacekeeping operations for the financial period ending 30 June 2000.
The Board's recommendations are that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations:
(a) Monitor peacekeeping missions closely to ensure that they implement audit recommendations and comply fully with instructions and established procedures (para.

Detailed findings and recommendations
A. Overpayment of mission subsistence allowance to civilian staff
In August 1993, the Internal Audit Division conducted an audit of UNIKOM and noted erroneous payments of mission subsistence allowance to the civilian international staff from the inception of the Mission in April 1991.
The audit disclosed that the civilian staff in UNIKOM had been paid mission subsistence allowance for weekends and holidays that fell during the period of annual leave and for compensatory time off for which no mission subsistence allowance credits had accrued.
The Internal Audit Division recommended that UNIKOM conduct a review and recover all mission subsistence allowance overpayments.
Although the Department of Peacekeeping Operations at various times provided guidance and direction to the Mission and specifically requested strict compliance with established rules in respect of payment of mission subsistence allowance, the Mission did not take a timely decision in connection with the recommendations of the Internal Audit Division made in August 1993.
The Mission, therefore, continued to effect the wrongful payment until 1996, when it again reviewed the situation and determined that $851,119 had been overpaid to 192 civilian international staff members between May 1991 and March 1996.
In April 1997, the Administration revised the amount overpaid to civilian international staff to $867,263.50.
The Board examined all the 192 worksheets prepared by the Mission and confirmed that between May 1991 and March 1996, mission subsistence allowance in the amount of $851,093.50 had been overpaid to 192 staff members rather than the amount of $867,263.50 estimated by the Administration.
The Board noted that the overpayments had been caused by the failure of the Mission to adhere to instructions from the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and to implement an important recommendation of the Internal Audit Division regarding the application of mission subsistence allowance.
Following a mission to UNIKOM, the Compensation and Classification Service, in April 1991, recommended that mission subsistence allowance be paid on a continuous basis, including time out for leave and for compensatory time off, within the prescribed limits.
It was not clear from the documentary evidence provided to the Board whether this recommendation had been approved by the Office of Human Resources Management.
Subsequently, in February 1992, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations instructed UNIKOM that civilian staff were not entitled to compensatory time off, but that for substantial and recurrent periods of overtime work, the Chief Administrative Officer could grant occasional time off subject to the exigencies of service.
In July 1993, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations informed the Mission that mission subsistence allowance should not be paid for weekends or holidays that fell within a staff member's annual leave.
The Board determined that between May 1991 and March 1996, of the total overpayment of $851,093.50, an amount of $305,197.50 had been paid to staff members for unearned occasional time off or compensatory time off taken outside the mission area.
Similarly, an amount of $202,285.50 had been paid to staff members for additional days spent outside the mission area.
The Board also noted that during the same period, an amount of $301,576.50 had been paid for weekends falling during leave spent outside the mission area and that a sum of $42,034 had been paid to staff members for holidays falling during leave spent outside the mission area.
All these payments were contrary to United Nations Headquarters' instructions.
The Board noted that although the Chief Administrative Officer had failed to implement the instructions of United Nations Headquarters on mission subsistence allowance, which had resulted in the overpayments, no disciplinary action had been taken against the officer.
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations informed the Board that it was only in July 1995, at the conclusion of the second review by internal auditors, that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations realized that the Mission had not corrected its procedures or initiated recovery actions for possible overpayments.
By that time, the Chief Administrative Officer had already separated from the United Nations (May 1995).
The Board noted that out of the amount of $851,093.50 overpaid to 192 staff members, $773,442.54 (91 per cent) had been recovered by the Administration, leaving a balance of $77,650.96 as at 31 January 2000.
The details of the recovery are provided in the table above.
The Board recommends that in future, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations monitor missions closely to ensure that they implement audit recommendations and that they comply fully with instructions and established procedures.
B. Payment of mission subsistence allowance to military observers
The Board noted that a total amount of $5,460,188.03 was initially alleged to have been overpaid by the Mission to 1,425 military observers between May 1991 and September 1996 in respect of mission subsistence allowance.
This included a payment of $1,448,117.33 to the military observers for mission subsistence allowance for days of leave taken in advance of entitlement and an amount of $2,343,980.70, which was paid on the basis of a formula that differed from the established one.
The balance of $1,668,090 was paid in compliance with the Notes for the Guidance of Military Observers on Assignment, which were in effect at the time of payment.
The details of the mission subsistence allowance paid to military observers are discussed below.
Advance payment of mission subsistence allowance
Military observers had been paid a total of $1,448,117.33 for days of leave taken in advance of entitlement.
Although this did not result in any overpayment, since the amounts paid were eventually earned, the Board was concerned about the propriety of making mission subsistence allowance payments in advance of entitlement.
The Board recommends that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations ensure that, in future, peacekeeping missions do not pay mission subsistence allowance in advance of entitlement.
Payment of mission subsistence allowance for days of compensatory time off
In accordance with the draft field administration manual, compensatory time off is earned at a rate of six days for each complete month of continuous service, including weekends and holidays.
Compensatory time off is given to military observers to provide them with opportunities for rest after especially arduous tours of duty.
Consequently, it is taken as soon as possible after completion of the continuous period of service.
Military observers are required to work for one full month before they are allowed six days of rest.
A directive from the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, dated 14 February 1992, which was sent to all missions, including UNIKOM, indicated that compensatory time off could be accumulated only for each month of completed service, emphasizing that no compensatory time would be earned for less than one month of service.
The Board noted that UNIKOM had applied a different method of computing compensatory time off, allowing 0.2 days of time off for each day of service, thus enabling military observers to take compensatory time off for less than a month's service.
In this regard, a sum of $2,343,980.70 was paid to military observers in respect of compensatory time earned, contrary to the provisions of the field administration manual.
Although the method adopted by the Mission in computing the compensatory time off was a departure from the established procedure and gave rise to a risk of overpayment, the Board concluded that this breach of procedure did not result in any final overpayment since the amounts paid were eventually earned.
Payment of mission subsistence allowance for days of compensatory time off taken in the military observers' home countries
The Notes for the Guidance of Military Observers on Assignment, dated June 1991, state that exceptionally and until further notice, military observers serving with UNIKOM may be paid the full rate of mission subsistence allowance during compensatory time off, wherever it is taken.
On the other hand, the draft field administration manual, issued in September 1992, states that mission subsistence allowance is payable in respect of compensatory time off regardless of whether it is spent in or outside the mission area, provided that no mission subsistence allowance is paid if a military observer spends compensatory time off in his or her home country.
The draft field administration manual establishes a general policy regarding mission subsistence allowance payments during compensatory time off, and the Notes for the Guidance of Military Observers on Assignment set the specific conditions for UNIKOM.
The Board considers that the provisions on mission subsistence allowance in respect of compensatory time off as set out in the draft manual are in conflict with the Notes for Guidance issued to military observers in June 1991.
On this point, the draft field administration manual in its preface specifies that it does not contain material that would provide a ready solution to every administrative problem that may arise in the field, and that it should always be read in conjunction with the relevant original manuals and/or rules and regulations or other documentation; in the case of any discrepancy between the text of the manual and that of the original documentation, the latter should prevail.
In this regard, the Board was of the opinion that the payment of $1,668,090 to military observers for days of compensatory time off taken in the military observers' home countries was in accordance with the Notes for the Guidance of Military Observers on Assignment, which was dated June 1991 and therefore valid.
In May 1997, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations issued another directive concerning the mission subsistence allowance payment for compensatory time off spent outside the mission area and instructed UNIKOM that all current and future guidelines on such matters as annual leave, compensatory time off and mission subsistence allowance for military observers and civilian police, including the Notes for Guidance and mission standard operating procedures, must reflect the United Nations policy as contained in chapter 7 of the draft field administration manual, with the following modification: mission subsistence allowance payments for compensatory time off spent outside the mission area, including in the home country, was to be reduced by half.
In all other respects, according to the directive, the draft field administration manual correctly stated United Nations standard policy on mission subsistence allowance, compensatory time off and annual leave for military observers and civilian police.
UNIKOM implemented the policy of reducing mission subsistence allowance by half for compensatory time off spent outside the mission area, effective 1 May 1997.
C. Field administration manual
The Board noted that the draft field administration manual issued in September 1992, which is used to guide the operations of field missions, had not been finalized.
The Board is pleased to note that the Administration issued detailed guidelines on mission subsistence allowance in administrative instruction ST/AI/1997/6, dated 20 October 1997.
The guidelines reflect the consolidation of mission subsistence allowance practices that have evolved over the years into a coherent policy that serves to standardize its application across all field operations and to simplify its administration.
The provisions in the administrative instruction, which came into force on 1 November 1997, have not been included in the field administration manual.
The Board recommended and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations agreed that the draft field administration manual should be reviewed, approved and regularly updated to facilitate the proper administration of field activities.
The Board was concerned about the various failures in the administration and payment of mission subsistence allowance in UNIKOM.
The Board recommends that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations identify lessons learned from the cases highlighted in the present report and disseminate them to all peacekeeping missions.
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations informed the Board that the promulgation of the new mission subsistence allowance policy in administrative instruction ST/AI/1997/6 appropriately addressed the problems that arose in UNIKOM and lessons identified from that case.

Agenda items 142 and 143
Financing of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991
Financing of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994
Comments on the report of the Expert Group to Conduct a Review of the Effective Operation and Functioning of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the note by the Secretary-General on the comments on the report of the Expert Group to Conduct a Review of the Effective Operation and Functioning of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (A/54/850).
The Committee also had before it the report of the Expert Group (A/54/634).
During its consideration of the Secretary-General's note, the Committee met with the Chairman of the Expert Group, the Registrars and the Deputy Prosecutors of the Tribunals and with representatives of the Secretary-General who provided additional information.
The Secretary-General's note included, in annex I, the comments of both the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) on the report of the Expert Group.
The note was prepared pursuant to General Assembly resolutions 54/239 and 54/240 of 23 December 1999, in which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to obtain comments and observations from the two Tribunals on the report of the Expert Group and to submit them, through the Advisory Committee, to the Assembly for consideration at its resumed fifty-fourth session.
In respect to the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the consolidated view of the Chambers, the Office of the Prosecutor and the Registry on most recommendations of the Expert Group are contained in annex I to the note by the Secretary-General (A/54/850); in some cases, where one or more organs have different views, their comments are presented separately.
The comments of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda are presented in a unified response, identifying the organ offering the views.
In addition, the Prosecutor of ICTY, who also serves concurrently as Prosecutor of ICTR, provided observations that cover both Tribunals.
The report of the Expert Group was prepared pursuant to General Assembly resolutions 53/212 and 53/213 of 18 December 1998, in which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General, inter alia, with a view to evaluating the effective operation and functioning of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, with the objective of ensuring the efficient use of the resources of the Tribunals, to conduct a review in full cooperation with the Presidents of the Tribunals, as recommended by the Advisory Committee in its reports1 and in the statement made by the Chairman of the Advisory Committee before the Fifth Committee at its 37th meeting, without prejudice to the provisions of the statutes of the Tribunals and their independent character and to report thereon to the relevant organs of the United Nations.
The Advisory Committee has also received a note prepared by ICTR on the current state of ICTR Registry operations, including recent reforms in the administrative and judicial support areas.
The Committee understands that the note is also being made available to the Fifth Committee.
The Committee acknowledges the great difficulties under which ICTR, in particular, operates, and underlines that these difficulties deserve continuing attention.
The Committee recalls its view that the main focus of the Expert Group review was to be on judicial rather than administrative management.
Nevertheless, it welcomes a number of the recommendations of the group that deal with administrative, budgetary and non-judicial matters.
It is the intention of the Committee to follow up on these recommendations in conjunction with its review of the respective budgets of the Tribunals.
The Committee trusts that the organs of the Tribunals will expeditiously resolve the above issues that fall within their purview.
The Board of Auditors and the Office of Internal Oversight Services are meanwhile encouraged to continue to pay particular attention to management issues that are within their mandates.
The Advisory Committee notes that, as indicated in paragraph 6 of the note of the Secretary-General (A/54/850), the report of the Expert Group contains 46 recommendations of which 16 recommendations have already been put into practice by the Tribunals (recommendations 1, 2, 6, 13, 14, 17, 18, 22 to 27, 31, 36 and 38) and 11 recommendations (4, 6, 7 to 12, 16, 17 and 31) have been expressly indicated as subject to further review by the Chambers of one or both Tribunals.
Furthermore, the Committee was informed that other recommendations that were in different stages of review for acceptance or otherwise included recommendations 3, 5, 6, 15, 20, 21, 34, 35, 37, 43 and 45, or elements thereof.
Given the nature and scope of the recommendations of the Expert Group, many comments, or certain elements thereof, fell into more than one category.
The Committee requests expeditious completion of this review.
The Advisory Committee notes that responses provided by ICTR on various recommendations were not as detailed or systematic as those given by ICTY.
The Advisory Committee notes that comments of the Secretary-General on those recommendations that may have implications for the administrative and financial functioning of the Tribunals, such as recommendations 15, 19 to 21, 29, 34 and 40 to 45, are also included in the note by the Secretary-General (A/54/850, annex I).
The Advisory Committee also notes that, with regard to matters under the purview of the Security Council, particularly those regarding possible modifications to the statutes of the Tribunals, such as recommendations 20, 21, 43 and 45, the Secretary-General intends to make arrangements to ensure that the Security Council has for its consideration the report of the Expert Group and his note.3 The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that in the event of a Security Council decision on additional judges, revised estimates would be presented.
In the event of approval by the Security Council of the recommendation to use temporary ad hoc judges as a practical solution for expediting the completion of trials, the procedures laid down in the resolution on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses would be followed, a practice similar to that followed in respect to ad hoc judges of the International Court of Justice.
The Advisory Committee further notes that, while the report of the Expert Group, together with the note by the Secretary-General, will be considered during the resumed session of the Fifth Committee under agenda items 142 and 143 on the financing of the Tribunals, it is expected that the Plenary of the General Assembly will also consider the report of the Expert Group and the note by the Secretary-General at its fifty-fifth session under the relevant agenda items on the reports of the Tribunals.
The Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly acknowledge with appreciation the report of the Expert Group.
The Committee notes that the report of the Expert Group was submitted to the Secretary-General on 11 November 1999.
The Committee recommends that the Secretary-General ensure that, before requesting additional resources for the Tribunals to implement a particular recommendation of the Expert Group, every effort should be made to fully and effectively utilize existing resources within the Tribunal concerned.
The Advisory Committee notes that recommendations 43 and 45 affect the statutory roles of the Registries vis-à-vis the Chambers and the Prosecutor in the matters covered by these recommendations.
In this connection, the Committee recalls that in recommending the establishment of the Expert Group it indicated that the review would be undertaken in full respect of the provisions of the statutes of the Tribunals.
Accordingly, unless the statutes are amended by the Security Council, the Committee recommends that the present practice followed by the two Tribunals on the matters covered in recommendations 43 and 45 continue to be followed.
Furthermore, the Committee would encourage that steps be taken by the Tribunals to implement such refinements, as may be necessary, to resolve those shortcomings that led the Expert Group to suggest the changes reflected in recommendations 43 and 45.
The Committee recommends, in this connection, that the Secretary-General prepare the budget proposals for the Tribunals for 2001 on the basis of the existing structure of the Tribunals.
In this connection, the Committee recalls its comments in its report of 2 December 1999.5
In the event that the Security Council were to decide to amend the statutes of the Tribunals, the Advisory Committee trusts that it would, in the first instance, carefully review and take fully into account the comments of the Secretary-General and of the organs of the Tribunals on recommendations 43 and 45.
Moreover, the Advisory Committee recommends that the Secretary-General prepare a separate report for the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, in the context of the budgets of the Tribunals, on the actions taken or to be taken in respect of the recommendations that remain under review, as mentioned in paragraph 6 above.
Furthermore a comprehensive report should be submitted to the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly on the results of the implementation of the recommendations of the Expert Group.

Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations
Letter dated 24 May 2000 from the Chargé d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Yugoslavia to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General
Following the statements made by the representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia in the Fifth Committee, I have been instructed by my Government to advise of the following.
The representatives of the three countries have abused the debate in the Fifth Committee on the administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations for political purposes and their malicious statements concerning the status of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are unfounded and tendentious.
Considering that the Fifth Committee is not a forum to discuss the status of a State Member of the United Nations, the statements of the representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia are yet another failed attempt to revise General Assembly resolution 47/1 of 22 September 1992, regulating the participation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the General Assembly of the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies and conferences organized under their auspices.
Clarifying the practical consequences of the adoption of the aforementioned resolution, the Legal Counsel of the United Nations maintained in his opinion of 29 September 1992 (A/47/485, annex) that the resolution “neither terminates nor suspends Yugoslavia's membership in the Organization”, which has become the generally accepted position of the United Nations on the participation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the work of the General Assembly.
The invocation of Security Council resolution 777 (1992) is immaterial as it does not regulate the status of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the General Assembly, which instead is regulated only by General Assembly resolution 47/1.
The position of the General Assembly relative to the continuing membership of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations has been confirmed on many occasions by resolutions adopted in this organ since the adoption of its resolution 47/1, in particular resolutions 47/229 and 52/215.
Furthermore, following the admission of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia to the United Nations, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia continued to participate in the work of, and vote in, the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies until 22 September 1992 and 29 April 1993, respectively.
The General Assembly has regularly assessed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia its annual contributions to the regular budget of the United Nations (1998: 0.060; 1999: 0.034; and 2000: 0.026), while the Secretary-General and the Secretariat of the United Nations continue to communicate with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as with any other State Member of the United Nations.
All documents and written communications of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with the Security Council and the General Assembly and its subsidiary bodies and United Nations specialized agencies are issued and circulated as documents of the United Nations.
In the agreements on normalization of relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that Macedonia and Croatia signed on 8 April 1996 and 23 August 1996, respectively, and in the Joint Declaration that the President of Bosnia and Herzegovina signed in Paris on 3 October 1996, the three States accepted the State continuity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, i.e., that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a State of continuity and not a new State.
Finally, following the adoption of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 27 April 1992 and the declaration made on that occasion by its Parliament to the effect that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would continue the international legal and political personality of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the subsequent notification thereof to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and all its Member States, none of them objected to the claim contained in the declaration notwithstanding the relevant practice of international law that such objections, if any, be made immediately.
In taking issue with the highly politically motivated attempts to question the status of my country in the world Organization, I would like to recall that, despite the fact that it has been unjustly denied full participation in the work of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council and that it is faced with a very difficult economic situation caused by years-long economic sanctions and the aggression of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization last year, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has heeded all calls you have addressed to the United Nations Member States and, whenever able to afford it, paid its contributions to the regular budget of the United Nations and carried out scrupulously all other obligations stemming from its membership in the United Nations and other international organizations.
The contention that the status of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations is linked with, and contingent upon, the solution of the issues of the succession of the previous Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is unfounded and aimed at confusing the States Members of the world Organization.
The status of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia should be solved in accordance with the Charter and the relevant rules of the United Nations, while the succession issues, i.e., the division of the assets and liabilities of the previous Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are the subject of a negotiation conducted between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav republics, turned independent States, in which all participants are equal and which, on the basis of an agreement based on the principles of international law, should lead to solutions acceptable to all.
I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 151.

Financing of the United Nations peacekeeping forces in the Middle East: United Nations Disengagement Observer Force Report of the Fifth Committee
* Reissued for technical reasons.
Rapporteur: Mr. Jan Piotr Jaremczuk (Poland)
I. Introduction
At its 3rd plenary meeting, on 17 September 1999, the General Assembly, on the recommendation of the General Committee, decided to include in the agenda of its fifty-fourth session the item entitled “Financing of the United Nations peacekeeping forces in the Middle East: United Nations Disengagement Observer Force” and to allocate it to the Fifth Committee.
The Fifth Committee considered the item at its 59th, 60th, 61st and 74th meetings, on 8 and 9 May and 2 June 2000.
Statements and observations made in the course of the Committee's consideration of the item are reflected in the relevant summary records (A/C.5/54/SR.59, 60, 61 and 74).
For its consideration of the item, the Committee had before it the following documents:
(a) Report of the Secretary-General concerning the financial performance of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 (A/54/707 and Corr.1);
(b) Report of the Secretary-General containing the proposed budget for the maintenance of the Force for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 (A/54/732);
(c) Reports of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/54/841 and Add.1).
Consideration of draft resolution A/C.5/54/L.80
At the 74th meeting, on 2 June, the representative of Côte d'Ivoire, coordinator of the informal consultations on this item, on behalf of the Chairman, introduced a draft resolution entitled “Financing of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force” (A/C.5/54/L.80).
At the same meeting, the Committee adopted draft resolution A/C.5/53/L.80 without a vote (see para.
Following the adoption of the draft resolution, a statement in explanation of position was made by the representative of the Syrian Arab Republic (see A/C.5/54/SR.74).
Recommendation of the Fifth Committee
The Fifth Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the following draft resolution:
Financing of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force
2 A/54/841 and Add.1. Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force1 and the related reports of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2
Recalling Security Council resolution 350 (1974) of 31 May 1974, by which the Council established the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, and the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended the mandate of the Force, the latest of which was resolution 1276 (1999) of 24 November 1999,
Recalling also its resolution 3211 B (XXIX) of 29 November 1974 on the financing of the United Nations Emergency Force and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, and its subsequent resolutions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 53/226 of 8 June 1999,
Reaffirming that the costs of the Force are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,
Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Force, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,
Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,
Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,
Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Force,
Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Force with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,
Concerned that the surplus balances in the Special Account for the Force have been used to meet expenses of the Force in order to compensate for the lack of income resulting from non-payment and late payment by Member States of their contributions,
Bearing in mind the reported hardships incurred by the local staff upon the relocation of the headquarters of the Force from Damascus to Camp Faouar,
Notes that some of the concerns regarding the improvement of the working conditions of the local staff in the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force have been addressed;
Requests the Secretary-General to continue the process of improving the working conditions of the local staff, including making allowance regarding difficulties resulting from the relocation of the headquarters of the Force from Damascus to Camp Faouar, through mutual and fruitful dialogue;
Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force as at 30 April 2000, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 17 million United States dollars, representing some 1.4 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Force to the period ending 31 May 2000, notes that some 24 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;
Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;
Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursements to troop contributors that bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;
Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Force in full and on time;
Expresses concern at the delay experienced by the Secretary-General in deploying and providing adequate resources to some recent peacekeeping missions, in particular those in Africa;
Emphasizes that all future and existing peacekeeping missions shall be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements;
Also emphasizes that all peacekeeping missions shall be provided with adequate resources for the effective and efficient discharge of their respective mandates;
Requests the Secretary-General to make the fullest possible use of facilities and equipment at the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, in order to minimize the costs of procurement for the Force, and for this purpose requests the Secretary-General to speed up the implementation of the asset management system at all peacekeeping missions in accordance with General Assembly resolution 52/1 of 15 October 1997; 3 A/54/841/Add.1.
4 To be adopted by the General Assembly. Endorses the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,3 and requests the Secretary-General to ensure their full implementation;
Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Force is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

Introductory note
The Heads of State and Government, meeting in the city of Cartagena de Indias, on the occasion of the fourteenth summit of Heads of State and Government of the Permanent Mechanism for Consultation and Concerted Political Action — Rio Group — hereby adopt the “Cartagena de Indias Declaration: Commitment for the Millennium”.

Cartagena de Indias, 14 June 2000
Cartagena de Indias Declaration
Rio Group 2000: Commitment for the Millennium
We, the Heads of State and Government of the Rio Group, which has now been expanded to include Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, have gathered in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 15 and 16 June 2000 as representatives of our peoples to continue the process of consultations and high-level concertation of political action to promote the ideals of the maintenance of peace, strengthening of democracy and promotion of sustainable development in our region and, in particular, to contribute to the preparation of the Millennium Summit to be convened by the United Nations next September.
The Millennium Summit affords us an historic opportunity to promote concrete initiatives for building an international system that offers greater justice, security and fairness for all, through a package of measures based on the values of cooperation and international solidarity.
We recognize that the main responsibility for strengthening the United Nations lies with its Members and we are confident that the results of the Millennium Summit will make a tangible contribution to the achievement of the Organization's aims and the strengthening of its capacity to respond to the growing challenges and needs of our peoples and nations.
We begin the new century committed to the consolidation and strengthening of representative democracy as a system of government and to the promotion of its values and defence of its institutions.
This commitment guides the actions of our Governments in both their domestic and foreign policies.
In this connection, we reiterate the importance of strengthening the rule of law and political pluralism, as well as of the responsible and ethical discharge of public duties.
We also stress the need to promote the effective and responsible participation of citizens and civil organizations in our nations' institutional life, as an increasingly necessary contribution to the debate on matters of public interest.
The phenomenon of globalization has brought with it challenges and opportunities for the countries of the region.
In recent years, the level of trade, financial flows and economic integration has soared dramatically.
However, we still face the major challenges of reducing economic and social inequalities and ensuring that the benefits of globalization are fully shared by all the peoples of the region.
We must seek creative ways of participating more actively in the process of globalization by taking advantage of new technologies, strengthening our cultural identity and projecting it to the rest of the world.
We reaffirm our commitment to respect the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international law and, in that connection, wish to place on record the following views on issues that are of prime importance to our region.
Commitment to the human dimension of development
We are of the view that economic growth should be used to reduce economic inequality in our nations and the high incidence of poverty that currently affects broad sectors of our societies.
To this end, we intend to allocate adequate resources to social expenditure, and especially to the development of human capital.
In order to meet social needs and to ensure equality of opportunities, we must increase the rate of sustainable economic growth and raise the productivity of our economies, within a favourable external environment.
We recognize the need to fund at one and the same time social protection networks and investments in human capital and infrastructure. In order to do so, higher levels of international cooperation are needed.
We consider the expansion of international trade flows to be essential and reject protectionist measures by the industrialized countries, particularly in the agricultural sector, which are not in keeping with the trade liberalization policy being pursued by the countries of our region.
Access to markets must therefore be guaranteed and the domestic subsidies and subventions granted by the developed countries eliminated so that Latin America could increase the level of its exports, which would in turn help to create jobs and improve social conditions.
We also appeal for a just and lasting solution to the problem of the external indebtedness of our economies, particularly those of the highly indebted countries of our region, so that debt would cease to be an obstacle to economic and social development and the most pressing needs of their populations could be met.
We consider universal access to basic education and a substantial improvement in its quality to be the pillars of our commitment to social development and a fundamental basis for productive human development and democracy.
We also consider it important to strengthen occupational training programmes and to promote the training of human resources in the use of advanced scientific and technological resources.
This task, together with the creation of more opportunities for productive employment, will be the basis for increased social and cultural participation by our young people.
Commitment to multilateralism
We are of the view that multilateralism promotes greater symmetry in international relations and contributes to transparency and to the development of equitable rules of the game, which would permit us to tackle global problems in a more timely manner and with greater effectiveness.
We therefore intend to strengthen the multilateral institutions and existing mechanisms for consultation and concerted political action as our contribution to the development of a more democratic and participatory international system.
We consider broad and democratic participation in multilateral institutions to be an important part of an equitable and balanced approach to global problems.
We also consider it essential to strengthen regional forums and to develop mechanisms for cooperation between them and the global multilateral organizations, while respecting their respective areas of competence.
Priority issues on the global agenda
As the world's first densely populated region to be free of nuclear weapons, with the signing of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, we maintain that nuclear disarmament is the responsibility of all States, primarily those which possess nuclear weapons, and that it is incumbent on the international community, represented in the United Nations, to take specific steps to promote the non-proliferation and the elimination of nuclear weapons.
We express our satisfaction with the outcome of the last Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which contained an unequivocal commitment to the complete elimination of such weapons, and we reaffirm our support for the initiative on a New Agenda for Disarmament.
In our hemispheres, we have developed such instruments as the Inter-American Convention Against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and other Related Materials, and we have undertaken to promote international agreement on this issue in the framework of the negotiations of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and to build on those activities on the occasion of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, to be held in the year 2001.
We urge all States which have not yet done so to ratify as soon as possible the Ottawa Convention to ensure the complete eradication of anti-personnel mines and we renew our commitment to the rehabilitation of victims and to the clearance of mines in our region, as well as to the goal of transforming our hemisphere into a zone free of anti-personnel mines.
We agree that the use of excessively cruel or inhuman weapons, particularly those which are home-made, should be prohibited in conflicts of any kind.
We agree that there should be a broad approach to the issue of human rights which covers civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights and which is based on respect for the dignity of persons and protection of their fundamental rights.
To that end, we intend to strengthen regional institutions that promote and protect human rights and to promote a culture of human rights in the hemisphere.
We reaffirm that the approach to the question of human rights should be based on the principles of non-selectivity, impartiality and objectivity and that human rights issues should be dealt with in an atmosphere of cooperation and with the strictest respect for the norms and principles of international law.
We intend to contribute to the progressive development of the international law on the criminal responsibility of the individual for the commission of certain international crimes, as provided for in the Statute of the International Criminal Court.
We are committed to fully respect the principles and norms of international humanitarian law and we appeal to all parties in any type of armed conflict to refrain from involving the civilian population, particularly children.
We consider unacceptable any action taken to address situations of emergency that is outside of the framework of the Charter of the United Nations, in accordance with the principles governing humanitarian assistance agreed upon by the General Assembly.
We reject all forms of intolerance, including xenophobia, racism and racial discrimination, and we are committed to promoting and protecting the rights of the most vulnerable groups of society.
In that regard, we attach great importance to the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, which is due to be convened in the year 2001.
We reaffirm that it is incumbent on the countries that send and receive migrants to strengthen their cooperation in the field of migration and to guarantee the full enjoyment of their human rights, especially the right to life and to dignified, just and non-discriminatory treatment.
We reaffirm that full gender equality is an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and we therefore pledge to mainstream the gender perspective into the public policies of our Governments.
We have adopted a comprehensive approach to the global problem of drugs, based on the principle of shared responsibility, and we believe that a determined effort on the part of the international community is needed to make this approach truly global, as the international community agreed in 1998 at the twentieth special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to the global problem of drugs.
In this connection, we have adopted at the regional level a multilateral evaluation mechanism, of an intergovernmental nature, which is an objective and balanced instrument that takes into account the special characteristics of the global problem of drugs in the region.
We now propose a period of review to permit an in-depth analysis of the background and results and we invite the United Nations to keep in mind the aforementioned mechanism with a view to the future elaboration of similar arrangements at a global level.
We subscribe to the Inter-American Convention against Corruption and are working towards its implementation and towards the elaboration of a similar instrument within the framework of the United Nations.
At the same time, we are intensifying our efforts to combat the laundering of money that represents the proceeds of various crimes.
We reaffirm our support for the principles of sustainable development agreed upon in Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, as well as in the Santa Cruz de la Sierra Plan of Action, including, in particular, the principle of shared but differentiated responsibility, and we strongly urge the developed countries to meet their targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases by ratifying the Kyoto Protocol by the year 2002.
In this connection, we attach particular importance to the Sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in The Hague in November 2000, and stress the need for early regulation of the implementation mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol, particularly the clean development mechanism.
We reaffirm the urgent need to mainstream environmentally friendly technologies and to develop sustainable production systems.
In order to achieve this objective, we shall continue to work towards the strengthening of our scientific and technological capacities and shall promote specific international cooperation initiatives, including initiatives to facilitate the transfer of technology.
We also reject the adoption of arbitrary and unilateral measures which are inconsistent with the multilateral trading system and based on labour-related criteria that restrict access by our products to other markets.
Reform of the international financial system
Because of the extraordinary expansion of the international financial markets, which is characterized by the proliferation of its agents and instruments and by the volatility of short-term capital flows, efforts at the national, regional and global levels should focus on the prevention of external crises.
At the national level, we agree on the importance of promoting responsible macroeconomic policies based on solid public finances, prudent monetary policies and suitable exchange regimes, in order to take advantage of the benefits of an increasingly integrated international economy.
This will permit the achievement of stable long-term growth, thereby reducing the vulnerability of the countries of the region and helping to prevent both external imbalances and fluctuations in production and employment.
The changes that have occurred in the global financial system in recent years make it necessary to reform the institutions responsible for the regulation of the system.
At the same time, we propose that these institutions should make additional efforts to disseminate and promote in all countries the application of internationally accepted standards in such areas as banking and financial supervision and regulation, as the main pillars of the stability of international financial markets.
One of the key objectives of the strengthening of the international financial architecture should be the creation of a framework that is conducive to the stability of financial and exchange markets, and within which, in extreme situations, adequate financial assistance is provided to countries that are in the process of adjusting their balance of payments situation.
We consider that the management of critical situations depends on the availability and timely provision of international liquidity to prevent the spread of financial crises and reduce their negative impact.
International financial institutions should improve their credit facilities through transparent, agreed upon and non-discriminatory mechanisms that help countries in difficulty to return to solvency and regain access to international financial markets.
We also urge the private financial sector to play an active and constructive role in the prevention and resolution of crises.
We propose to strengthen the international financial system and at the same time further develop regional and subregional financial institutions by taking advantage of their comparative advantages, ensuring more effective coordination of their activities and avoiding duplication of functions.
We stress the importance of the high-level meeting on finance for development to be convened by the United Nations in 2001, which will bring together the international community and the main international financial and trade organizations.
This forum provides an excellent opportunity to adopt the measures necessary to continue to promote the reform and strengthening of the international financial system.
In addition to having the capacity to prevent and to deal effectively with external crises, the new international financial system should provide a suitable framework for access to long-term resources and technical assistance for economic and social development as well as provide financing for social and infrastructural projects.
This is necessary in order to reduce poverty, raise the level of well-being of our societies and strengthen support policies and social security networks, with a view to substantially improving living conditions in our region.

Agenda item 99 (g)
Sustainable development and international economic cooperation: renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership
Letter dated 30 June 2000 from the Chairman of the Second Committee addressed to the President of the General Assembly
With reference to your letter of 28 April 2000 requesting me to undertake, on your behalf, consultations with Member States on the date, modalities, nature of the outcome and focus of the discussions of the second high-level dialogue on the theme of “Responding to globalization: facilitating the integration of developing countries into the world economy in the twenty-first century”, I have the honour to report to you hereby the results of the consultations held on 9 June 2000.
In discussing their options as regards the four components — date, modalities, nature of the outcome and focus of the discussions — delegations took account of the experience of the first high-level dialogue held in September 1998, as well as the recent experience of preparing and organizing high-level events, such as the high-level segment of the Economic and Social Council, the Millennium Assembly, and others.
With respect to the date, delegations felt that the two-day high-level dialogue should be held, as in 1998, immediately before the commencement of the general debate at the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.
With regard to the modalities, delegations considered that, in order to stimulate high-level interest and ensure interactive dialogue, a combination of plenary meetings, ministerial round tables and informal panels would be the best approach to follow.
Such a format would allow delegations to make brief formal statements at the plenary meetings, and at the same time facilitate productive interactive discussions, as well as an infusion of views and analyses from non-governmental panellists.
The ministerial round tables would be open for members of delegations to attend.
With regard to the outcome, it was decided that, taking into account time constraints of a two-day event, a President's summary presented at the closure of the dialogue would be the most appropriate outcome.
This summary may, at a later stage, be expanded to include such material as, for instance, summaries of ministerial round tables and informal panels, and any concluding observations the President may wish to present.
This overall summary could be presented as a report of the President to the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session.
Delegations agreed that taking into account the deliberations of the Millennium Summit, the high-level segments of the substantive sessions of 2000 and 2001 of the Economic and Social Council, the financing for development process and the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, the focus of the discussions, within the overall theme of the dialogue, should be on the following sub-themes:
- Promoting the integration of developing countries into the world economy and generating new public and private financial resources to complement development efforts;
- Enhancing the integration of developing countries in the emerging global information network, facilitating access for developing countries to information and communication technology.
I ask that you have the present letter distributed as a document of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly in connection with agenda item 99 (g).
Fifty-fourth session
Agenda item 49 (b) United Nations reform measures and proposals: the Millennium Assembly of the United Nations
Held at United Nations Headquarters from 22 to 26 May 2000
Note by the Secretariat
In his note entitled “United Nations Reform: measures and proposals — A Millennium Assembly, the United Nations system (Special Commission) and a Millennium Forum” (A/52/850), the Secretary-General expressed the view that if the United Nations were to continue to play a vital role in the century ahead it would be imperative that it benefit from the imagination and engage the support of the world's people.
In this connection, he proposed that non-governmental organizations and other civil society actors organize a Millennium Forum in connection with the Millennium Assembly.
Civil society organizations organized and convened the Millennium Forum, which was held from 22 to 26 May 2000 at United Nations Headquarters.
The final document, entitled “We the Peoples Millennium Forum Declaration and Agenda for Action: strengthening the United Nations for the twenty-first century”, adopted by the Millennium Forum on 26 May 2000, is transmitted herewith.
We the Peoples Millennium Forum Declaration and Agenda for Action:
Strengthening the United Nations for the twenty-first century
We, the 1,350 representatives of over 1,000 non-governmental organizations and other civil society organizations from more than 100 countries, have gathered at the United Nations Headquarters in New York from 22 to 26 May 2000 to build upon a common vision and the work begun at civil society conferences and the United Nations world conferences of the 1990s, to draw the attention of Governments to the urgency of implementing the commitments they have made, and to channel our collective energies by reclaiming globalization for and by the people.
Our vision is of a world that is human-centred and genuinely democratic, where all human beings are full participants and determine their own destinies.
In our vision, we are one human family in all our diversity, living on one common homeland and sharing a just, sustainable and peaceful world, guided by the universal principles of democracy, equality, inclusion, voluntarism, non-discrimination and participation by all persons, men and women, young and old, regardless of race, faith, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity or nationality.
It is a world where peace and human security, as envisioned in the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, replace armaments, violent conflict and wars.
It is a world where everyone lives in a clean environment with a fair distribution of the earth's resources.
Our vision includes a special role for the dynamism of young people and the experience of the elderly, and reaffirms the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights — civil, political, economic, social and cultural.
We begin the new millennium facing grave and interconnected challenges.
As actors in the struggle for peace, justice and the eradication of poverty, NGOs encounter daily the human impact of rising violence and armed conflicts, widespread violations of human rights and unacceptably large numbers of people who are denied the means of a minimal human existence.
At the same time, new and emerging diseases, such as human immunodeficiency syndrome/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), threaten to devastate entire societies.
Globalization and advances in technology create significant opportunities for people to connect, share and learn from each other.
At the same time, corporate-driven globalization increases inequities between and within countries, undermines local traditions and cultures and escalates disparities between rich and poor, thereby marginalizing large numbers of people in urban and rural areas.
Women, indigenous peoples, youth, boys and girls and people with disabilities suffer disproportionately from the effects of globalization.
Massive debt repayments are still made by the poorest nations to the richest, at the expense of basic health care, education and children's lives.
Trafficking in women, sexual exploitation, drug trafficking, money-laundering, corruption and the flow of small arms promote insecurity.
States are becoming weaker, while an unaccountable transnational private sector grows stronger.
A single-minded focus on economic growth through uncontrolled free markets, combined with the adjustment and stabilization policies of international financial institutions controlled by the rich creditor nations, are crippling many national economies, exacerbating poverty, eroding human values and destroying the natural environment.
Globalization should be made to work for the benefit of everyone to eradicate poverty and hunger globally; establish peace globally; ensure the protection and promotion of human rights globally; ensure the protection of our global environment; and enforce social standards in the workplace globally.
This can happen only if global corporations, international financial and trade institutions and Governments are subject to effective democratic control by the people.
We see a strengthened and democratized United Nations and a vibrant civil society as guarantors of this accountability.
And we issue a warning: if the architects of globalization are not held to account, this will not simply be unjust; the edifice will crumble, with dire consequences for everyone.
In the end, the wealthy will find no refuge, as intolerance, disease, environmental devastation, war, social disintegration and political instability spread.
We wish to put forward a series of concrete steps to strengthen cooperation among all actors at the international, national, regional and local levels to make this vision a reality.
Our Agenda for Action includes steps that should be taken by civil society, Governments and the United Nations.
A. Eradication of poverty, including social development and debt cancellation
Poverty is a violation of human rights.
With some 1.3 billion people living in extreme poverty, it is the most widespread violation of human rights in the world.
Poverty not only exists in the developing countries but is also a dramatic and hidden reality in the industrialized countries.
Particularly affected are disadvantaged and under-represented groups — indigenous people, people with disabilities, women, children, youth and the elderly.
Hunger and the HIV/AIDS pandemic are also closely related to poverty.
Processes of impoverishment inherent in the global economic system are resulting in increasing inequity, social injustice and violence worldwide.
The eradication of poverty has become a matter of urgency.
Poverty eradication is not an automatic consequence of economic growth; it requires purposeful action to redistribute wealth and land, to construct a safety net and to provide universal free access to education.
We call on our Governments and the United Nations to make poverty eradication a top political priority.
The Forum urges:
The United Nations:
To act as an independent arbitrator to balance the interest of debtor and creditor nations and to monitor how debt cancellation funds are spent.
To introduce binding codes of conduct for transnational companies and effective tax regulation on the international financial markets, investing this money in programmes for poverty eradication.
To immediately establish at the United Nations a global poverty eradication fund, which will ensure that poor people have access to credit, with contributions from Governments, corporations, the World Bank and other sources.
To adopt cultural development as the focus theme of one of the remaining years of the International Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1996-2007).
Governments:
To implement fully the commitments made at the World Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen in 1995, in partnership with all actors of civil society in an integrated and holistic framework.
Governments should focus their efforts and policies on addressing the root causes of poverty and providing for the basic needs of all, giving special priority to the needs and rights of the disadvantaged and under-represented.
We further call on the Governments to anchor the Copenhagen goals in their national statutes and to introduce national anti-poverty strategies that provide safety nets and basic livelihood allocation as a right.
To strengthen the entrepreneurial capacity of women, indigenous people and people in the informal productive sector, ensuring access to credit, to enable them to become self-employed.
This is the sure way of creating jobs for all and a sustainable way of eradicating poverty.
To increase spending for health research and to ensure that the fruits of this research reach the people.
To recognize the special potential of people with disabilities and ensure their full participation and equal role in political, economic, social and cultural fields.
To provide universal access to “Education for all”, prioritizing free basic education and skills training for poor communities to improve their productive capacities.
We call on Governments to increase budgets for education, to reduce the technology gap and to restructure educational policy to ensure that all children (girls and boys) receive moral, spiritual, peace and human rights education, while acknowledging, through programmes for families, adult literacy and the elderly, that education is a lifelong process.
To move towards economic reforms aimed at equity, in particular to construct macroeconomic policies that combine growth with the goal of human development and social justice; to prevent the impoverishment of groups that have emerged from poverty but are still vulnerable to social risks and exclusion; to improve legislation on labour standards, including the provision of a minimum legal wage and an effective social system; and to restore people's control over primary productive resources as a key strategy for poverty eradication.
To introduce and implement programmes to eradicate corruption in Governments and civil society at large, and to promote good governance, accountability, democracy and transparency as the foundation for public ethics.
To adopt comprehensive, integrated policies so that priorities of such government departments as trade and defence are in line with policies for international sustainable development.
To promote the use of indigenous crops and traditional production skills to produce goods and services.
To explore the feasibility of a legally binding convention on overcoming poverty, to be drafted in effective consultation and partnership with people living in poverty themselves.
To direct international financial institutions to cancel 100 per cent of the debt owed to them and to establish an arbitration process that balances the interests of debtor and creditor nations, with an independent arbitrator who will ensure discipline and transparency.
To call on the World Trade Organization (WTO) to rectify urgently the agriculture agreements that put pressure on developing countries to liberalize food imports, threatening their rural livelihoods, employment, natural resources, indigenous knowledge, and food production and security in general.
Civil society:
To monitor and pressure Governments to ensure that all the 10 commitments made at the World Summit on Social Development become a reality for all.
To develop new relations and partnerships among community institutions, educators, scientists, researchers, local authorities, businesses, labour and NGOs in a constructive dialogue and planning process so that all can contribute their best. To pay special attention to those who have suffered most from poverty and to those who have the least opportunity to be heard by others.
The poor must see themselves as real partners and must be empowered to enhance and employ their own abilities and resources in order to be of service to themselves, their families, their communities and their common home.
To exert our best efforts to implement the Universal Declaration of Human Rights — affirming the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of all rights, civil, political, social, economic and cultural — and to join the global movement for human dignity.
To dedicate attention to the special needs of the young and the elderly, especially those from the South, and to provide opportunities for them, including access to information, and all forms of health care and education, which are essential to the eradication of poverty.
To direct special action to decrease high levels of youth unemployment to all global stakeholders at the local, national, regional and international levels.
B. Peace, security, and disarmament
The United Nations and its Member States have failed to fulfil their primary responsibility of maintaining peace and preserving human life.
Organized armed violence is depriving millions of people all over the world — 95 per cent of them civilians — of their lives, and many millions more of their right to peace.
The victims of Hiroshima/Nagasaki A-bombs and of the century's other wars have vehemently warned us that the errors of the twentieth century must not be repeated in the twenty-first.
However, the killing is continuing.
Six million people have died in over 50 wars in the last decade.
There have been some successes, but many of these conflicts have lasted for decades, with millions of dead.
The cycle of violence begins with cultures that glorify violence and warrior virtues, and may be manifest in domestic violence.
Despite over 50 years of effort, no decisive progress has yet been made in eliminating nuclear weapons, which are still capable of destroying all life on this planet, and the circle of their possessors is expanding.
For mainly commercial reasons, there is no adequate verification for treaties prohibiting biological weapons, while knowledge of how to produce them spreads.
Rape continues to be used as a weapon of war.
Space has been militarized and space weapons are being actively developed.
For the moment, the problem is centred in a small group of eight States that are claiming for themselves the right to possess weapons that could destroy all of humankind.
Disarmament alone is not the way to peace; it must be accompanied by genuine human security.
It is imperative that NGOs be included in the dialogue for peace.
The world community — civil society, including younger and older people, and Governments — has the resources and knowledge to move from a culture of violence to a culture of peace.
The time has come to carry out the primary mission set forth in the United Nations Charter, “to preserve future generations from the scourge of war”, and to apply the principle of non-use of force, which is fundamental to the Charter of the United Nations.
Working together, both civil society and Governments can make armed conflict increasingly rare and can move, step by step, to the abolition of war.
The Forum urges:
The United Nations:
To carry out the objective of moving towards the abolition of war by practical means, the United Nations Secretariat and interested Governments, or a separate group of Governments, should develop a draft proposal for global disarmament to be discussed in a fourth special session of the General Assembly on disarmament.
This proposal would be aimed specifically at reducing the level of armed violence throughout the world through continuing improved conflict prevention, peacekeeping, conventional disarmament and nuclear weapons abolition, in a programme designed to be promoted by a broad coalition of civil society organizations, particularly youth organizations, as well as by interested Governments.
To establish a corps of at least 50 professionally trained mediators for more effective conflict prevention, to assist in conflict warning, mediation and conflict resolution.
To authorize, through the General Assembly, the establishment of an international, non-violent, inclusive, standing peace force of volunteer women and men to deploy to conflict areas to provide early warning, facilitate conflict resolution, protect human rights, and prevent death and destruction.
To draw on legal systems for conflict prevention and resolution, such as those of indigenous peoples, who have conflict resolution mechanisms of their own.
To ensure that no “non-discriminatory” weapons, such as landmines and sub-munitions, are used by any military force, in particular by any force or coalition acting under a United Nations mandate.
To assist the Security Council on conflict prevention in a more flexible way, the General Assembly should establish an open-ended conflict prevention committee to serve a rapid action conflict prevention and early warning function.
It should give the world public, civil society, the United Nations, and national Governments balanced, timely information on potential conflicts and promote possible solutions.
To respect national sovereignty and the prohibition of the use of force, which are fundamental in the Charter of the United Nations. This principle must not be undermined.
In the solution of conflicts, all peaceful methods in accordance with Chapter 6 of the Charter must be tried before measures of force are undertaken in accordance with Chapter 7.
The General Assembly should set up a broad commission to analyse standards for forceful action in cases where crimes against humanity, war crimes or genocide are committed.
To expand the United Nations arms register in order to show the production and sale of small arms and light weapons.
It should include specific names of their producers and traders.
To reopen the Peace Education Unit in the Department of Political Affairs, with provisions for continuous liaison with NGOs.
To establish a humanitarian commission composed of independent experts to work with the Security Council, the Secretary-General and other United Nations agencies.
The mandate of this commission would be to assess humanitarian needs and recommend protective measures for civilian populations in times of armed conflict.
To establish ready police and peacekeeping forces.
Sensitivity and respect for civilians, especially women and children, should be included in the training of all peacekeepers.
To establish an annual youth peace prize for signal accomplishments in this field.
Governments:
To promptly carry out their obligations in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to eliminate all nuclear weapons and to ban them.
For this purpose, Governments should, by the beginning of the year 2001, convene the conference to eliminate nuclear dangers, as proposed by Secretary-General Annan.
Governments should immediately undertake to close laboratories that research and develop new nuclear weapons, to de-alert nuclear weapons and to withdraw nuclear weapons from foreign States.
Together with nearly all Governments that participated in the recent Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty review conference, Forum participants consider that unilateral deployment of nationwide missile defence by any country could have dangerously destabilizing effects and create pressures to permanently retain high levels of nuclear weapons or even to increase existing levels.
The deployment of theatre missile defences in Asia or other regions could have serious regional destabilizing effects.
Such plans should be relinquished in favour of a worldwide missile launch warning system and a conference to review methods of ending production of long-range surface-to-surface missiles and long-range bombers.
To expand the network of nuclear free zones until they cover all areas other than territory of weapons States and to complement that network by maritime measures that close ports to naval vessels unless they certify that they are not carrying nuclear weapons.
Civil society should energetically promote all these measures to control nuclear weapons.
To initiate a worldwide freeze on armed forces and a 25 per cent cut in production and export of major weapons and small arms, and to that end to adopt an international code of conduct on arms exports, as the beginning of worldwide build-down of conventional forces.
To implement the International Anti-Personnel Landmines Convention of 1997, also known as the Ottawa Treaty, to ban anti-personnel landmines.
To establish a commission at the United Nations to devise ways of stopping the technological development of new and more advanced weapons that create new imbalances in global power relationships.
The Conference on Disarmament should also establish a working group on this subject.
To establish peace education, including coping with domestic conflict, covering all ages from young children to older adults, at all levels from pre-school through university and non-formal community education.
Education for peace and conflict avoidance is essential for moving towards sustainable peace.
Implementation of this obligation of each national Government should be assured by an appropriate treaty.
To increase their efforts to promote and to comply with international humanitarian laws, limiting the methods and means of war and protecting non-combatants, civilian populations and humanitarian personnel.
The international community — civil society, Governments and the United Nations — has a responsibility to stop promptly any genocide, war crimes or any massive violations of human rights.
All those involved should seek to avoid any confusion between humanitarian help and military intervention.
To immediately adopt measures to implement the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, so that children up to the age of 18 will be prohibited from participation in armed conflict.
Civil society:
To give special attention and support to those disabled and injured by violent conflict, to children and the elderly, and to the reintegration into society of former combatants.
Protection of war-affected children in conflict zones must become a worldwide campaign.
To maintain the impartiality and independence of all NGOs working for peace, security, disarmament and humanitarian issues from political, military and economic powers and institutions.
At the same time, NGOs should organically link with popular movements promoting equity, justice and diversity (such as the labour movement, women's movements and civil rights movements).
To protect the humanitarian principles that are linked with human rights and reject all attempts to transform the field of humanitarian assistance into a new market open to private companies.
C. Facing the challenge of globalization: equity, justice and diversity
“Globalization” needs defining.
To some, it is an inevitable process driven by new technologies in electronic communication and transport, enabling information, persons, capital and goods to cross borders and reach the most remote corners of the globe at unprecedented speed.
It is transforming our world into a global village, with consequent political and economic changes that open unprecedented possibilities of prosperity to all its inhabitants.
To most, globalization is a process of economic, political and cultural domination by the economically and militarily strong over the weak.
For example, the combined assets of the top 200 corporations in the 1960s were 16 per cent of world gross domestic product.
This increased by the early 1980s to 24 per cent and in 1995 had risen to 34 per cent.
In this process, not only does the gap between the “haves” and “have nots” widen but the ranks of the poor are swelling, civil societies are being threatened, pushing an increasing number into extreme poverty, and Governments are becoming dependent.
The current globalization process is not inevitable; it is the result of decisions taken by human beings.
It can and must be redirected to become a democratic process in which the people are at the centre as participants and beneficiaries.
We, of all ages — in particular our future generation the youth — claim a space for that transnational civil society that even now is rising on the world scene with unprecedented ties, networking, exchanges and common action among peoples, groups, communities and organizations.
Before us is an emerging new consciousness worldwide that affirms shared values of peace, equity, social justice, democracy and human rights.
Indigenous peoples are deeply concerned that the ongoing process of globalization and trade liberalization is, in many instances, leading to the denial of indigenous peoples' rights to their ancestral territories and violating their rights to the security of their land tenure, including their spiritual perspective on land and development, their traditional knowledge, their culture and their political and socio-economic systems.
The Forum urges:
The United Nations:
To reform and democratize all levels of decision-making in the Bretton Woods institutions and WTO and integrate them fully into the United Nations system, making these institutions accountable to the Economic and Social Council.
To develop a legally binding framework for regulating the actions of transnational corporations (TNCs), respecting the international labour, human rights, and sustainable environmental standards set by the United Nations and its relevant specialized agencies.
The regulatory mechanism should include the active participation of workers and communities directly affected by TNC operations in order to prevent abuses and to subordinate TNCs to democratic civil authority and community-based modelling of socio-economic systems.
To exempt developing countries from implementing the WTO Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights Agreement and to take these rights out of any new rounds of negotiations, ensuring that no such new issues are introduced.
To examine and regulate transnational corporations and the increasingly negative influence of their trade on the environment.
The attempt by companies to patent life is ethically unacceptable.
To move towards democratic political control of the global economy so that it may serve our vision.
To recognize and enshrine legislatively the right of self-determination of indigenous peoples and to acknowledge their sovereign right to their languages, knowledge, educational systems, living spaces, intellectual property and biological security.
Governments:
To recognize that aspects of globalization seriously threaten environmental sustainability and cultural diversity and heritage, as well as the common good.
To exclude fresh water, food, education, health care and other human essential common goods from private monopolization, and to regulate them with the view to protecting and expanding the global commons.
To protect indigenous peoples' rights through legislation, in the face of corporate transgressions of these rights.
To develop migration policies, both emigration and immigration, in conformity with human rights standards, particularly to respect the global principle of freedom of circulation for all.
To direct the international financial institutions to eliminate the negative conditionalities of structural adjustment programmes. To reform the international financial institutions (IFIs) and the World Trade Organization to ensure greater transparency and democracy and to support the establishment of a consultative mechanism with civil society.
To endeavour to stop the globalization of education among children and youth through which large corporate entities are allowed to compromise or control the education system and marginalize the role of local and national Governments.
To exclude from commercial exchange the human body and parts of the human body.
Civil society:
To support community self-reliance and democracy by ensuring people-centred, free and independent non-commercial media infrastructures, including community radio, telephone and personal computers.
To support the development of a concept of globalization defined from a polycentric and pluri-cultural perspective, assuming and respecting, preserving and developing cultural diversities.
D. Human rights
Entering the new millennium, the fulfilment of human rights is threatened by numerous challenges.
The increasing economic gaps and the unprecedented increase in poverty that are the result of the existing world economic order constitute the greatest and most unjust violations of human rights: the misery and death of millions of innocent people every year.
We are witnessing some of the worst violations of human rights, including the use of food as a weapon, in the context of the armed conflicts and civil wars, which have been erupting with increasing frequency.
Moreover, civilians are bearing the brunt of the deployment of weapons of mass and indiscriminate destruction in such conflicts.
We are also witnessing a resurgence of racism, fascism, xenophobia, homophobia, hate crimes, ethnocide and genocide, which impact most greatly on indigenous peoples and other disadvantaged or under-represented groups; the resurgence of patriarchy that threatens to erode the gains made by women; the persistence of the worst forms of child labour; the impunity enjoyed by perpetrators of massive and systematic violations of human rights; the ongoing and deepening process of globalization, which undermines internationally recognized human rights, labour rights and environmental standards; the continued insulation from human rights accountability of non-state actors, ranging from transnational corporations and international financial institutions to fundamentalist civil society organizations and criminal syndicates; an upsurge of violence, militarism and armed conflict; the increase and growth of authoritarian regimes; and the fact that human rights defenders continue to be highly vulnerable targets of repression in many areas of the globe.
The United Nations human rights treaty regime, composed of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the relevant covenants and conventions, is acknowledged to be one of the three core objectives of the United Nations — human rights, development and peace.
In the twenty-first century, we must make advances on all three fronts simultaneously or we will put our world at great risk.
Indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of human rights
The indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights have been repeatedly reaffirmed at the level of rhetoric.
However, in practice civil and political rights have been given a higher priority than economic, social and cultural rights, often to the detriment of both sets of rights.
The United Nations:
To review its own human rights institutions and practices to achieve balance in the allocation of resources to both sets of rights, and to conclude expeditiously the negotiations on the draft optional protocol to the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
To expeditiously adopt binding international instruments on the rights of indigenous peoples, minorities, older persons and the disabled.
Governments:
Not to justify neglect of one set of rights over the other but to ensure that all individual and collective human rights are safeguarded in the pursuit of sustainable development, investment and trade.
Civil society and especially human rights organizations:
To fully appreciate the indivisibility of human rights.
The human right to development
Member States, by consensus at several United Nations global conferences, have reaffirmed the right to development as an inalienable human right and an integral part of fundamental human freedoms.
The Forum urges:
All Governments, the United Nations and civil society:
To cooperate in appropriate actions to effectively realize the right to development as a matter of utmost urgency so that the basic needs of all peoples, including indigenous peoples, the disadvantaged and the under-represented, are fulfilled.
In this context, the immediate cancellation of poor country debt is imperative.
Universal ratification, without reservations
Universal ratification of international human rights treaties, which are the result of already completed international negotiations, is essential if they are truly to provide a common human rights standard for humanity.
Regional and national human rights instruments have a vital contribution to make to strengthening and complementing international human rights standards.
The Forum urges:
The United Nations:
To strengthen its technical cooperation, enabling Governments to ratify human rights treaties and fulfil their obligations thereunder.
To ensure that no new international or regional treaties are adopted that contravene existing human rights instruments.
Governments:
To fulfil their commitments already made in this regard at the 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human Rights and to set specific time-frames for reviewing reservations and initiating national processes for considering ratification.
Civil society:
To continue to press Governments to ratify and remove reservations and to raise public awareness of the importance of so doing.
National implementation
The Forum is concerned about the hypocrisy of States that fail to incorporate into their national laws the international human rights treaties they have ratified.
Moreover, even where national laws exist, implementation leaves much to be desired.
The United Nations agencies:
To ensure that Governments fulfil their treaty obligations, including their reporting and implementing obligations, providing, if necessary, the technical cooperation needed to do so.
Governments:
To effectively incorporate and implement the human rights treaties that they have ratified.
To eliminate prostitution of boys and girls and the worst forms of child labour.
Civil society:
To draw attention to failures in implementation and identify obstacles and ways of overcoming them.
Moreover, they are entitled to full protection in so doing.
International implementation of human rights standards
The Forum expressed concern about continuing selectivity and double standards in the international enforcement of human rights.
The Forum stressed the need for more effective adherence to international human rights standards, especially by the Governments of the permanent members of the Security Council and all other members as well.
At the same time, it is essential for international organizations of trade, finance and investment, as well as transnational corporations, to be held fully accountable for their policies and actions that impact on human rights and workers' rights.
The Forum insists that:
The United Nations:
Resume its leadership role in spearheading negotiations towards a binding international code of conduct for transnational corporations.
Ensure that all international organizations are fully compliant with international human rights standards and core labour rights.
Draft and adopt an international convention on the rights of persons with disabilities to promote and protect the human rights of persons with disabilities.
Stop imposing economic sanctions, which deprive people of their basic economic, social and environmental rights and which make their struggle for survival, as well as for civil and political rights, more difficult.
Governments:
Adopt and implement national policies and laws to effectively protect their peoples from violations of their human rights resulting from the actions of such organizations.
Support and not repress civil society organizations, particularly human rights defenders and others monitoring violations and working towards redress.
Civil society organizations:
Sensitize Governments to their obligation to protect human rights defenders.
Promoting and protecting the rights of women and girls
The goal of ending all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls also remains unmet.
The Forum affirms the universality and indivisibility of women's rights as human rights, and calls for an end to all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls.
The Forum recognizes the human rights of all women and girls as an unalienable, integral and indivisible part of human rights that must be promoted and realized at all stages of the life cycle.
The Forum calls on the United Nations, Governments and civil society to recognize and assure equal opportunity and full participation of women in all aspects of society, including leadership, the economy and decision-making.
The United Nations:
To ensure that gender mainstreaming effectively brings women into leadership positions throughout the system and a gender perspective into all its programmes and policies; to provide gender training; and to strengthen its mechanisms for the protection and promotion of the human rights of women and girls.
Governments:
To allocate more resources and create an enabling environment for implementation of their commitments to women's and girl's human rights, including the promotion of women into decision-making positions, the repeal of all discriminatory laws, the introduction of effective legislation to prevent violence against women and girls, protection for the full diversity of women, the enforcement of legislation promoting women's and girls' equality, the collection of sex-disaggregated data and the guarantee of women's and girls' rights to development, education and health.
Civil society:
To fully incorporate women into leadership at every level and gender perspectives into all its operations; to hold Governments accountable for their obligations to promote and protect the human rights of women and girls; and to act as monitors of the implementation of commitments to end discrimination and violence against women and girls.
Promoting awareness of and support for asserting human rights
Forum participants reiterated the importance of human rights education in building a culture of human rights and empowering people to claim their rights.
The Forum advocates that:
Take effective steps to make meaningful its Decade on Human Rights Education (1995-2004).
The historic and economic roots of racism must be brought to the attention of the United Nations World Conference on Racism in order to advance the struggle against racism.
Focus more attention on the protection of human rights of older persons and adopt effective measures for full respect and implementation of their rights.
Heighten awareness of the human rights of peoples in disputed territories and conflict areas where freedom of speech and movement is severely restricted.
Agencies should refrain from exploiting the images of victims in conflict areas because this dehumanizes them.
Ensure the removal of all obstacles impeding civil society in such activities and advocate human rights education for all.
Civil society:
Continue and strengthen its activities in promoting human rights awareness across all sectors of society.
Universal realization of human rights
Human rights will not be truly universal unless they are realized for all, including neglected or excluded groups and groups at risk, notably children, youth, older persons, women, minorities, indigenous peoples, refugees, internally displaced persons, migrants, immigrants, the disabled the mentally ill, the unemployed, the homeless and those subject to discrimination on grounds of race, religion, caste, sex, place of birth, language, age, nationality, sexual orientation or other grounds.
Economic exploitation, cultural practices and other factors continue to impede the realization of human rights for many and diverse groups.
Unequal economic development between countries promotes forced migration to developed countries.
The human rights of these economic migrants, especially those labelled as alien or undocumented, are systematically violated without consideration of their significant contribution to the host country economy.
The goal of ending all forms of colonization in the world remains as yet unachieved and the right to self-determination is far from universally realized, especially for peoples living under occupation.
Further, in the context of the right not to be complicit in killings, we call for full legal recognition of the rights of conscientious objectors.
The Forum urges:
The United Nations:
To strengthen the existing international human rights system to ensure full recognition, respect for and realization of human rights for all; and to implement all United Nations resolutions calling for self-determination and an end to military occupation.
To protect the rights of people under military occupation.
To strengthen the monitoring of human rights violations of migrant workers and their families.
To establish a fair and effective International Criminal Court (ICC).
Governments:
To take all steps, including affirmative action, where necessary, to remedy the continuing neglect of people whose human rights are yet unrealized; and to move urgently to sign and ratify the ICC treaty.
To provide effective redress and remedies for the victims of human rights violations, ensuring that the burden of proof does not fall on the victim.
Civil society:
To fortify its advocacy role in pressing for the recognition and realization of human rights for all, and to encourage all States to sign and ratify promptly the ICC treaty.
E. Sustainable development and the environment
Sustainable development is the recognition that environment and development issues should be addressed in an integrated manner.
Agenda 21 also promoted the concept of major groups, wherein sectors of society, including local Governments, are acknowledged as important players in bringing about sustainable development.
Eight years have passed since the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held at Rio de Janeiro in 1992, and there is a feeling of frustration by civil society over the slow progress or non-implementation of commitments by national and international bodies.
The spirit of Rio is diminishing.
The commitment of developed nations to allocate 0.7 per cent of their gross national product (GNP) to overseas development assistance to developing nations has been met by very few countries.
The transfer of environmentally sound technology from developed countries to developing countries is hampered by intellectual property rights demands.
The balance between environment and development is tilted towards the environmental concerns favoured by the Governments of developed countries.
The dominant patterns of production and consumption are being globalized, causing more environmental devastation of life-supporting ecosystems and massive loss of biodiversity.
The Brundtland Commission recommended that sustainable development be considered on an equal footing with economic, ecological and social development.
Currently, globalization is giving priority to economic development at the expense of social development and ecological conservation.
The effects of such unsustainable development has marginalized and impoverished many, including the owners and custodians of traditional knowledge and biodiversity, indigenous peoples, older persons, farmers and women.
Globalization must incorporate local sustainability.
Due to the efforts of some civil society organizations together with some countries from the South and the North, the issue of bio-safety has occupied centre stage in the Convention on Biological Diversity.
The adoption of the Bio-safety Protocol in late 1999 was a major breakthrough in regulating the transborder transfer of genetically modified organisms.
The Forum urges:
The United Nations:
To strengthen its capacity to monitor Governments and require their compliance with Agenda 21, their commitments made in Rio, commitments made during sessions of the Commission on Sustainable Development, the Copenhagen Declaration, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
To make a global assessment of unsustainable development and its impacts on environment, human settlements and social development, thereby building upon the studies made by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and other United Nations agencies and civil society organizations.
On the basis of these studies and policy proposals, it should play an active role in promoting a world solidarity fund and in regulating international financial institutions, trade bodies and corporations to ensure that they adhere to the principles and programmes adopted in Rio and Copenhagen.
To forge stronger partnerships and broader cooperation with major groups, including local governments and those sectors that are actively involved in bringing about sustainable development, especially at the local level.
It should also coordinate and harmonize the policies and programmes of the various United Nations agencies and bodies to ensure that duplication is avoided and synergy is achieved.
To encourage its organs, especially the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and UNDP, to actively support the establishment of sustainability centres to advise local governments on the implementation of Agenda 21 in local communities through comprehensive, integrated development policies and strategies.
Such centres should be part of international networks for the exchange of knowledge and experience.
To support positive action for indigenous peoples and other groups who experience discrimination as a barrier to progress.
Such groups include women, youth, children, older persons, people with disabilities, occupied peoples, refugees, minorities, displaced persons and migrants.
To establish a global habitat conservation fund to purchase comprehensive protection of threatened, critical ecological habitat worldwide.
The fund should accrue revenues from a nominal (0.5 -1.0 per cent) royalty on worldwide fossil energy production — oil, natural gas, coal — collecting at least $5 billion to $10 billion annually.
To examine how it should restructure to implement the changes necessary to give clear priority to sustainable human development.
To encourage UNEP and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature to create an appropriate legal framework for the protection of marine life.
Governments:
To comply with and implement the declarations, conventions and treaties they have signed and meet the commitments they have made, including those in Agenda 21.
They should ratify the important protocols of the multilateral environmental agreements, including:
(a) Agreements which set frameworks for the reduction of global warming (these should be ratified by 2002);
(b) The Bio-safety Protocol;
(c) The agreement by donor Governments to allocate 0.7 per cent GNP for official development assistance.
To assess the negative environmental and social impacts of unsustainable development and focus on how they could be redressed.
Their development programmes should promote sustainable development, such as the conservation of water resources, sustainable agriculture, the development of renewable energy sources and support for the sustainable development knowledge and practices of indigenous peoples, women and farmers, while eliminating military and unsustainable infrastructure projects.
To endorse the Earth Charter in the General Assembly.
To establish and strengthen multi-stakeholder mechanisms, such as national councils for sustainable development, to facilitate the implementation of Earth Summit agreements.
To promote the establishment of microcredit facilities, especially for farmers and women, and to promote their access to forms of land tenure that facilitate access to and ownership of land.
To increase interactions between central and local government organizations for the common goal of improving living conditions in urban and rural settlements.
To adopt comprehensive, integrated development policies and strive to enable local communities to achieve self-sufficiency and management of local natural resources, achieving sustainability through land use control and through measures that reduce resource-intensive forced consumption.
To recognize and enshrine in legislation the right of self-determination of indigenous peoples, and their right to be guided by their own principles and perspectives, as expressed in their draft declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples that has been submitted to the United Nations.
Civil society:
To continue challenging Governments and international institutions to adhere to the agenda for sustainable and social development.
It should also monitor the way Governments are implementing Agenda 21 and the Copenhagen Declaration.
To broaden and strengthen the involvement and action of various sectors of civil society involved in developing and nurturing sustainable patterns of production and consumption.
Documentation of best practices by civil society in the area of sustainable and social development should be shared.
To enhance networking between civil society organizations and movements.
The diverse perspectives and experiences of different sectors — women, indigenous peoples, farmers and others — should be widely disseminated and integrated in the formulation of development models at the local, national and international levels.
To actively promote awareness of the fact that once basic needs have been met, human development is about being more, not having more.
Fundamental changes in human values are the best means to transform the culture of consumerism.
To adopt and disseminate the Earth Charter as a tool for promotion of values and actions which will create sustainable development.
To ensure that an appropriate liaison be developed between the NGO Steering Committee of the Commission on Sustainable Development and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Sports and Environment Commission to harmonize implementation of the IOC's Agenda 21 for Sports and the Environment within the United Nations system.
To welcome the concept and support implementation of the Internet global environmental fund proposed by Global Environmental Action, by which global citizens can participate in funding civil society organizations to implement sustainable development projects.
F. Strengthening and democratizing the United Nations and international organizations
A major task of the world community in the twenty-first century will be to strengthen and greatly enhance the role of the United Nations in the global context.
Governments must recommit themselves to the realization of the goals and mandates of the Charter of the United Nations.
A challenging task is to firmly protect the integrity of the United Nations, counter the erosion of its role, and further strengthen and augment international institutions capable of implementing and enforcing international standards, norms and law, leading towards the formation of a new political and economic order.
The world community must be particularly concerned over the ongoing trend towards diminishing the influence of developing countries in the governance of international institutions, which will only undermine their credibility and effectiveness.
Strengthening and democratizing the United Nations and other international institutions will require the broad support and involvement of member States, regional bodies, civil society and citizens everywhere, including young and older people.
The United Nations:
To strengthen the coordinating role of the General Assembly to ensure that it can fulfil the mandates that it already has according to the Charter of the United Nations.
To make the Security Council more representative of the world.
Permanent membership in the Security Council is problematic because it blocks change and fails to accommodate evolving realities.
Thus, the United Nations should begin to phase out the existing permanent membership in favour of a more flexible and accountable system.
The Council should be immediately enlarged with newly elected members drawn from member States from different regions of the world on a rotational basis.
To limit and move towards eliminating the use of the veto.
The veto must be restricted to Chapter VII peace issues only.
It is unacceptable that the veto should apply to such matters as election of the Secretary-General.
Complete veto abolition should be sought as a step towards the elimination of permanency.
Among other things, the Security Council must take more action to prevent conflict over raw materials and other basic resources.
A greatly expanded Secretariat office on the prevention and resolution of conflict is required, as is a fund that can quickly be deployed to mitigate conflict-producing social and economic crises.
To make the International Court of Justice (ICJ) the locus of a more effective, integrated system of international justice.
The compulsory jurisdiction of the world Court must be accepted by all States.
In the absence of voluntary compliance, the Security Council should enforce ICJ decisions and other international legal obligations under Article 94 of the Charter of the United Nations.
To consider the creation of a United Nations parliamentary body related to the General Assembly.
One proposal that should be considered is the creation of a consultative parliamentary assembly.
Any parliamentary body established at the United Nations should have its membership selected through an election process, and should conduct its business in an open, democratic manner.
To act on the resolution of the Commission on Human Rights calling for the establishment of a permanent forum for indigenous peoples.
To provide a key role in arbitrating between the interests of creditors and debtor nations and in monitoring how funds released by debt cancellation are spent.
To recognize and support young people and youth organizations as active participants and equal partners in all United Nations processes.
The independence and integrity of their work must be protected.
The United Nations and Governments are urged to support the initiatives and efforts set up by youth organizations themselves.
To strengthen information exchange and coordination among international organizations and specialized agencies so that the work developed by such bodies as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is taken into account by the other organizations and bodies within their own policies.
To guarantee that international meetings and information documents involving civil society representatives are translated into the main international languages: English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Russian and Chinese.
To take measures to guarantee and to facilitate the participation of NGO representatives based in developing countries, Eastern Europe and indigenous peoples.
To strengthen the United Nations contact with citizens by providing increased resources for NGO relations offices throughout the United Nations system and by enhancing the United Nations network of information centres, as an indispensable resource in mobilizing support for the United Nations among the world's peoples.
Governments:
To increase substantially the regular and peacekeeping budgets of the United Nations.
The United Nations cannot carry out its many urgent tasks without substantially more resources and more staff.
This budget could be doubled immediately, to very good effect.
United Nations budget problems have had a serious negative effect on peacekeeping.
In addition, the budgets of United Nations agencies should be increased to better support their work.
To pay United Nations dues on time, in full and without conditions.
United Nations discussion of global taxes and fees have been stifled by the threat of a funding cut-off by a single Member State.
This blackmail must be rejected, and the United Nations must vigorously explore the possibilities of alternate funding from such sources.
To move towards creation of alternative revenue sources for the United Nations.
The United Nations should set up expert groups and begin the necessary intergovernmental negotiations towards establishing alternative revenue sources, which could include fees for the commercial use of the oceans, fees for airplane use of the skies, fees for use of the electromagnetic spectrum, fees on foreign exchange transactions (i.e., the Tobin Tax) and a tax on the carbon content of fuels.
To ensure that a gender perspective is integrated at all remaining stages of the process to establish the International Criminal Court and at all stages of the proceedings of the functioning Court, and that the particular needs of children, the elderly and persons with disabilities are considered.
Governments should complete the process of extending to NGOs rights of access and participation in the General Assembly and its Main Committees and subsidiary bodies.
Civil society:
To support the creation and funding of a global civil society forum to meet at least every two to three years in the period leading up to the annual session of the General Assembly, provided that such a forum is conducted democratically and transparently and is truly representative of all sectors of civil society and all parts of the world.
Fifty-fourth session
Agenda item 123
Joint Inspection Unit
Note by the Secretary General
In accordance with article 9, paragraph 2, of the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit, the Secretary-General has the honour to transmit to the members of the General Assembly the work programme of the Unit for 2000 and the preliminary list of potential reports for 2001 and beyond.
Programme of work of the Joint Inspection Unit for 2000 and preliminary listing of potential reports for 2001 and beyond
I. Introduction
The following work programme has been drawn up in accordance with article 9, paragraph 1, of the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit, contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 31/192 of 22 December 1976, and takes into account the guidelines laid out in successive Assembly resolutions on the functioning of the Unit, in particular resolution 50/233 of 7 June 1996 and 54/16 of 19 November 1999.
Section II of the present document contains the Unit's programme of work for 2000; and section III, a preliminary listing of potential reports for 2001 and beyond, which includes subjects the Unit has identified to be dealt with after the completion of the ongoing reports.
As hitherto, the programme of work is subject to change in the course of the year: new reports may be added; planned reports may be modified, postponed or cancelled when circumstances warrant; and titles may be changed to reflect the new thrust of reports.
The Unit would highly appreciate receiving any comments from the legislative organs, other external and internal oversight bodies and the secretariats of participating organizations on the content of the programme of work for 2000 and/or the preliminary listing of potential reports for 2001 and beyond.
A. Common and joint services in Vienna
The item was included in the work programme for 1999 but was not initiated during that year.
The report is part of the ongoing series of Joint Inspection Unit reports on common administrative services for United Nations system organizations co-located at different duty stations.
Previous reports in the series include: United Nations system common premises and services in the field (A/49/629); common services at United Nations Headquarters (A/51/686), as well as the Secretary-General's comments contained in document A/51/686/Add.1 and the Unit's comments thereon (A/51/686/Add.2); and, more recently, United Nations system common services at Geneva: overview of administrative cooperation and coordination (A/53/787), the second part of which, containing case studies of selected common services at Geneva, will be issued shortly.
The shared objectives of those reports is to provide impetus and a rational framework for the development and management of common administrative services in order to scale down overhead structures and costs and achieve more cost-effective methods and tools of programme delivery.
B. Review of management and administration in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has been facing administrative and managerial problems despite its ongoing reform process, which was introduced in 1988.
The Director-General of UNESCO proposed that the Joint Inspection Unit should carry out a management review to help UNESCO find solutions to those problems.
The review will focus on: (a) results-based planning, programming, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation; (b) management information system; (c) external and internal oversight and control; (d) human resources management; and (e) field representation and decentralization.
The Unit report will be submitted to the Executive Board of UNESCO at its one hundred sixtieth session, to be held in October 2000.
C. Report on delegation of authority in the United Nations Industrial Development Organization
The Joint Inspection Unit included in its 1999 programme of work a report on delegation of authority. The subject had been proposed by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).
The report originally intended to take stock of the current situation in the secretariats of the United Nations and UNIDO, to evaluate experience gained so far and to develop certain standards for delegation of authority to be applied in future cases.
During the preparation of the report the Inspectors came to the conclusion that the question was so important that it deserved to be the subject of separate reports addressed to individual organizations.
D. Review of management and administration in the World Health Organization
The report will be the third in a series following up on the Joint Inspection Unit report on accountability, management improvement and oversight in the United Nations system (A/50/503) and the Joint Inspection Unit report on more coherence for enhanced oversight in the United Nations system (A/53/171).
A first report on the International Labour Organization (ILO) was issued in 1999 and a second on UNESCO is included in the present work programme.
The report will review recent major management reforms and initiatives at WHO, and consider the applicability of the recommendations contained in the two Joint Inspection Unit reports on oversight mentioned above.
E. Planning, programming, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation in the United Nations system: learning from best practices
In spite of its management objective, a planning, programming, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation system has not worked coherently within the United Nations system.
In particular, the interconnection of each step of the cycle has not been effective, resulting in an improper functioning of such a system.
A number of United Nations system organizations have initiated results-oriented reform processes to improve their planning, programming, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation systems, in order to cope more adequately with requirements for efficiency and accountability.
However, proper design and review of the current systems cannot be done without systematic consideration of the cycle as a whole.
The review aims at clarifying the concept of the new results-oriented approach, identifying the impact of its application to the whole cycle, and suggesting principles and ways to improve, within the framework of the results-based approach, the current methodologies for planning, programming, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation of United Nations system organizations.
Through analysis and action-oriented recommendations, the report will assist Member States and United Nations system organizations in designing and reviewing results-based systems with a view to using them as an effective management tool.
The review has been included in the work programme upon suggestions made by a number of secretariats of the organizations participating in the Joint Inspection Unit: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Economic Commission for Europe (ECE), Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), International Maritime Organization (IMO), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Universal Postal Union (UPU), UNIDO, Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), United Nations and UNESCO.
F. Report on support costs on programmes and activities financed from extrabudgetary resources
The question of support costs has been a long-standing issue in the United Nations system.
Given the ever-increasing activities financed from extrabudgetary funds, a comprehensive and clear methodology for the administration of programme support costs would need to be established on a United Nations system-wide basis.
So far, the Joint Inspection Unit has carried out several reviews on the subject.
G. Comparative analysis of the management of junior professionals in the organizations of the United Nations system
The demographic profile of staff in most organizations of the United Nations system, where up to half of the members of the secretariats are due to retire during the present decade, combined with evolving mandates and policies requiring new types of skills not always available among the staff, call for a rejuvenation of the human resources of the secretariats.
At the same time, some of the organizations are faced with a growing number of resignations of staff in the lower echelons of the Professional category that migrate to other labour markets.
The major objective of the report will be to compare policies and practices in the organizations of the system with regard to the recruitment and management of entry-level of professional staff as well as the rate of retention of their professional staff with a view to identifying possible causes of this migration trend, highlighting the best and most cost-efficient practices for the recruitment and management of junior Professionals and making concrete recommendations as to ways to prepare a cadre of dedicated and competent professionals for the participating organizations.
H. Handling of oversight reports by legislative organs
The objective of the report is to examine the practices of the legislative organs of the Joint Inspection Unit participating organizations in the handling of oversight reports, and to present recommendations to enhance overall effectiveness and impact of oversight activities on the basis of shared responsibility.
The proposed report is complementary to the previous Joint Inspection Unit report entitled “More coherence for enhanced oversight in the United Nations system” (A/53/171), and is basically a synthesis, with an expanded coverage, of a series of notes on the handling of Joint Inspection Unit reports by various participating organizations produced during the course of 1999 and early 2000.
The report will deal with questions such as coordination among oversight mechanisms at each organizational level, forums where and how oversight reports are to be considered and follow-up on the recommendations made by oversight bodies by duly taking into account the development of the ongoing interaction of the Joint Inspection Unit with the participating organizations.
I. Review of management and administration of the United Nations Office at Geneva
The objective of the review is to examine the structure of the United Nations Office at Geneva, and its management and administration practices, with a view to recommending concrete measures to improve its cost-effectiveness.
The review will provide an assessment of the capacity of the United Nations Office at Geneva as potential provider of additional common services to the United Nations system organizations based in Geneva.
It will also review the quality of the services provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva to other United Nations offices in Geneva with a view to improving these services and making them more cost-effective.
This review will build on an earlier report of the Unit, which reviewed United Nations system common services at Geneva (A/53/787) by focusing on the potential for enhancement of the current role and performance of the United Nations Office at Geneva.
J. Management of buildings: case study of United Nations Headquarters
The past report of the Joint Inspection Unit on the management of buildings in the United Nations system (A/50/753) provided early warning that negligence in systematic maintenance of properties of the organizations, due to chronic underfunding, was both dangerous and expensive in the medium and long term.
To cope with the needs of repair, replacement of equipment and upgrading of buildings, the report recommended, inter alia, the establishment of buildings funds supported by fixed regular contributions.
Responding to the suggestion from the United Nations Secretariat, the Unit will review this subject, in particular in the context of urgent needs of major repairs and upgrading works in the United Nations Headquarters buildings.
Profiting from the experience of other organizations of the United Nations system, the planned report is aimed at examining and recommending financial and operational options to address the present situation, as well as measures to avoid such problems in the future.
K. Administration of justice in the organizations of the United Nations common system: options for higher recourse instances
The main objective of the report, which is a corollary to the Joint Inspection Unit report on the administration of justice at the United Nations (A/55/57), is to provide an in-depth review of the various systems of administration of justice at the organizations in the United Nations system, particularly as regards higher instances of appeal in respect of decisions of the lower judicial and semi-judicial bodies.
The review is aimed at formulating recommendations designed to ensure maximum efficiency and expediency in the administration of justice in the organizations in the United Nations common system, bearing in mind the possibility of reducing costs and effecting savings through the merging of existing judicial institutions and the pooling of their resources.
Subjects for analysis in the context of the proposed report include: the International Court of Justice as the principal judicial organ in the United Nations system; the relationship between the two main administrative tribunals in the United Nations system — the United Nations Administrative Tribunal and the ILO Administrative Tribunal; the establishment of a unified higher appeal instance for the United Nations system as a whole, offering a recourse against decisions of the tribunals and ensuring consistent application of legal standards among the lower-instance bodies at the system organizations; and different options for a second-tier appellate mechanism.
Preliminary listing of potential reports for 2001 and beyond
The following are indications of subjects that the Inspectors have identified for potential reports to be prepared during the course of 2001 and beyond.
The list is tentative and does not necessarily imply that the Unit is committed to taking up those subjects:
(a) Review of the financial situation in the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA);
(b) Review of management and administration in FAO;
(c) United Nations revenue-producing activities: income generation and cost recovery;
(d) Evaluation of international drug control activities in the United Nations system;
(e) Evaluation of the United Nations Volunteers (UNV);
(f) Evaluation of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS);
(g) Successfully extending technical cooperation projects to the end beneficiaries;
(h) Effectiveness of the Performance Appraisal System in the United Nations system.
Notes
According to article 11, paragraph 5 of its statute, the Unit produces notes submitted to the executive heads for use by them as they may decide.
In this regard the Unit plans to issue notes on the following subjects:
(a) Handling of reports of the Joint Inspection Unit by IMO;
(b) Handling of reports of the Joint Inspection Unit by the World Food Programme;
(c) Handling of reports of the Joint Inspection Unit by UNIDO;
(d) Handling of reports of the Joint Inspection Unit by the International Atomic Energy Agency;
(e) Handling of reports of the Joint Inspection Unit by UNESCO;
(f) Handling of reports of the Joint Inspection Unit by the United Nations;
(g) Review of the reform process in the International Trade Centre UNCTAD/WTO;
(h) Shipment entitlement in the United Nations system and option of a lump sum.

Fifty-fourth session
Agenda item 22
Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal
Solemn appeal made by the President of the General Assembly on 1 September 2000 in connection with the observance of the Olympic Truce
The President of the General Assembly has the honour to make the following solemn appeal in connection with the observance of the Olympic Truce:
On 24 November 1999, the General Assembly adopted resolution 54/34, in which it urged Member States to observe the Olympic Truce during the games of the XXVII Olympiad, which will be held at Sydney, Australia, from 15 September to 1 October 2000.
The idea of the Olympic Truce dates back to an ancient Greek tradition of ekecheiria, in keeping with which all hostilities would cease during the Games.
Today, the Olympic Truce has become an expression of mankind's desire to build a world based on the rules of fair competition, peace, humanity and reconciliation.
Moreover, the Olympic Truce epitomizes a bridge from the old and wise tradition to the most compelling purpose of the United Nations — the maintenance of international peace and security.
As the most visible illustration of this connection in goals and aspirations between the Olympic movement and the United Nations, the flag of the United Nations now flies at all competition sites of the Olympic Games.
The forthcoming Sydney Games — the first Olympic Games of the twenty-first century and of the new millennium — should be a harmonious, athlete-oriented and environmentally committed event.
The period of the Games, and beyond, should provide an opportunity for dialogue, reconciliation and the search for durable solutions for the restoration of peace in all areas of conflict, where the first victims are the children, the youth and women.
Humanity's quest is for a world free of hatred and war, a world where ideals of peace, goodwill and mutual respect form the basis of relations among countries.
That goal may still remain elusive, but if the Olympic Truce can help us to bring about even a brief respite from conflict and strife, it will send a powerful message of hope to the international community.
With the United Nations flag flying in Sydney at the XXVII Olympic Games, adherence to the Truce will gain even greater symbolism.
I therefore solemnly appeal to all States to demonstrate their commitment to the spirit of fraternity and understanding among peoples by observing the Olympic Truce during the Sydney Games.
I urge all those who are now engaged in armed struggle — for whatever reasons and wherever it might be — to suspend hostilities in keeping with the observance.
I urge everybody, individually and collectively, to take the initiative to abide by the Olympic Truce as a way of promoting goodwill and encouraging the peaceful settlement of conflicts in full conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.

Commending the efforts by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS to coordinate and intensify efforts to address HIV/AIDS in all appropriate forums,
Recognizing also that the needs in countries to address AIDS far outweigh both the human and the financial resources being made available and that high-level political commitment is critical to strengthen the response to the epidemic,

Agenda item 22 (continued)
Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal (A/54/971)
The President: The General Assembly will now resume consideration of agenda item 22, entitled “Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal”.
In this connection, I should like to draw the attention of the General Assembly to document A/54/971, which contains a solemn appeal that I made on 1 September 2000 in connection with the observance of the Olympic Truce.
I will now read the solemn appeal:
“On 24 November 1999, the General Assembly adopted resolution 54/34, in which it urged Member States to observe the Olympic Truce during the games of the XXVII Olympiad, which will be held at Sydney, Australia, from 15 September to 1 October 2000.
“The idea of the Olympic Truce dates back to an ancient Greek tradition of ekecheiria, in keeping with which all hostilities would cease during the Games.
“Today, the Olympic Truce has become an expression of mankind's desire to build a world based on the rules of fair competition, peace, humanity and reconciliation.
Moreover, the Olympic Truce epitomizes a bridge from the old and wise tradition to the most compelling purpose of the United Nations — the maintenance of international peace and security.
As the most visible illustration of this connection in goals and aspirations between the Olympic movement and the United Nations, the flag of the United Nations now flies at all competition sites of the Olympic Games.
“The forthcoming Sydney Games — the first Olympic Games of the twenty-first century and of the new millennium — should be a harmonious, athlete-oriented and environmentally committed event.
The period of the Games, and beyond, should provide an opportunity for dialogue, reconciliation and the search for durable solutions for the restoration of peace in all areas of conflict, where the first victims are the children, the youth and women.
“Humanity's quest is for a world free of hatred and war, a world where ideals of peace, goodwill and mutual respect form the basis of relations among countries.
That goal may still remain elusive, but if the Olympic Truce can help us to bring about even a brief respite from conflict and strife, it will send a powerful message of hope to the international community.
With the United Nations flag flying in Sydney at the XXVII Olympic Games, adherence to the Truce will gain even greater symbolism.
“I therefore solemnly appeal to all States to demonstrate their commitment to the spirit of fraternity and understanding among peoples by observing the Olympic Truce during the Sydney Games.
“I urge all those who are now engaged in armed struggle — for whatever reasons and wherever it might be — to suspend hostilities in keeping with the observance.
I urge everybody, individually and collectively, to take the initiative to abide by the Olympic Truce as a way of promoting goodwill and encouraging the peaceful settlement of conflicts in full conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.”
May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to take note of the solemn appeal in connection with the observance of the Olympic Truce?
It was so decided.
The President: May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item 22?
It was so decided.
Agenda item 49 (continued)
United Nations reform: measures and proposals
(b) The Millennium Assembly of the United Nations
Draft resolution (A/54/L.89)
The President: The General Assembly will resume its consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 49, entitled “The Millennium Assembly of the United Nations”.
In this connection, the General Assembly has before it a draft resolution issued as document A/54/L.89.
In view of the need to dispose of this item expeditiously, I should like to consult the Assembly with a view to proceeding immediately to consider the draft resolution contained in document A/54/L.89.
In this connection, since the draft resolution has been circulated only this morning, it would be necessary to waive the relevant provision of rule 78 of the rules of procedure, which reads as follows:
“As a general rule, no proposal shall be discussed or put to the vote at any meeting of the General Assembly unless copies of it have been circulated to all delegations not later than the day preceding the meeting.”
Unless I hear any objections, I will take it that the Assembly agrees with this proposal.
It was so decided.
The President: I give the floor to the representative of Iraq.
Mr. Al-Humaimidi (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): My country's delegation already presented its comments on paragraph 9, bullet 8, dealing with sanctions.
We wish to reaffirm here that this eighth bullet contains a double-standard provision relating to economic sanctions.
The paragraph does not reflect the point of view of the international community and United Nations Member States.
As expressed many times, General Assembly resolution 51/242, adopted by consensus, puts forward the basic principles — namely, the need to exhaust all peaceful means before resorting to sanctions, which can only be considered as a last resort.
Economic sanctions, if necessary, can be imposed only when they are in conformity with the principles of the Charter, after having determined the objectives of the sanctions, having a clear time table and having included provisions allowing for a regular re-examination of the sanctions and precise conditions linked to lifting them.
Sanctions cannot be used for the purposes of pure revenge or reprisal.
Unfortunately, the United States and the United Kingdom and their Kuwaiti agents have insisted on maintaining this subparagraph as it is.
This paragraph allows innocent populations to be targeted through sanctions.
My delegation is surprised to see how this double standard policy can be so flagrantly used in such a United Nations document, adopted on the eve of the new millennium.
Why are we asking for a reduction of the harmful effects of the economic sanctions against innocent populations, and at the same time ask that they be removed from third countries?
It would be better to remove the harmful effects of sanctions from innocent populations as well as third parties.
My delegation has shown great flexibility in order to reach a consensus text.
Unfortunately, once again we are forced to note that the United States, the United Kingdom and their Kuwaiti agents have insisted on keeping this paragraph, which has no legitimacy, either legal or moral.
The delegation of this country cannot accept such a shameful text.
The President: As President of the General Assembly, I must take very serious exception to your implication that I too, as President of the General Assembly, am somehow under the control of those countries you mentioned, or others.
There were more countries than those that you have mentioned who did not support you.
You have the right to place on record the position of your Government, but I take very serious exception to the implication contained in the statement you have just made.
I was fair to every single delegation, and the ruling that I made was based on a more than clear consensus of those who were present and joined the consensus.
We have heard the last speaker in the debate on sub-item (b) of agenda item 49.
We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution A/54/L.89.
The Assembly will now take a decision on that draft resolution, entitled “Draft United Nations Millennium Declaration”.
May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/54/L.89?
Draft resolution A/54/L.89 was adopted (resolution 54/282).
The President: I shall now call on those representatives who wish to speak in explanation of position on the resolution just adopted.
Mr. Doutriaux (France) (spoke in French): On behalf of the European Union, we are happy with the work that you, Mr. President, have carried out.
France has a reservation to the idea of convening an international conference to identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers.
In relation to the options which can lead to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, we would recall our preference for convening a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.
Ms. King (United States of America): On behalf of the United States I would like to make some comments on the document which we are transmitting to the fifty-fifth General Assembly to be read as a declaration at the end of the Millennium Summit to be held from 6 to 8 September.
Earlier this year, the fifty-fourth General Assembly accepted an important challenge.
The challenge was to draw upon the observations so eloquently expressed in the Secretary-General's March report, a discussion of the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century, in order to develop a declaration which would allow the Heads of State and Government who are even now converging on New York to reaffirm their faith in the United Nations and its Charter.
I do not need to tell you, Mr. President, or anyone else gathered in this room, that the draft we have before us is the result of extensive negotiation and significant compromise by many, if not all, member States.
Our combined goal was a consensus document summarizing values essential to international relations in the twenty-first century, and identifying key objectives for the future.
While the document we have before us generally meets that goal, the United States has reservations about certain aspects of this text.
Specifically, in the section referring to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, the document continues to refer to keeping all options open, including the possibility of convening an international conference to identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers.
The United States has strong and often repeated reservations to such a conference.
The United States welcomes the reference in this document to the issue of climate change and is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
We believe strongly that climate change is a global problem requiring a global solution.
We also note that economic growth and emissions growth need not go together.
Over the past two years, United States economic growth has been 4 per cent or higher, and growth in greenhouse emissions has been 1 per cent or lower.
With respect to the Kyoto Protocol, the United States notes that ratification in many countries, including the United States, is subject to the approval of national legislators, and that no reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are required by the Protocol, unless and until that agreement is ratified and enters into force.
Finally, in the important section focused on meeting the special needs of Africa, the United States regrets that the paragraph describing measures to address the challenges of poverty eradication and sustainable development in Africa, made reference to debt cancellation.
The United States believes that it would have been more accurate and useful to refer to the need, which the United States recognizes and supports, for member States and international financial institutions to work with the Governments of African countries to develop programmes of debt relief, including debt forgiveness, taking into account demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction.
Mr. Gatilov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): In view of the adoption of draft resolution A/54/L.89, by which the Assembly decides to refer the draft United Nations Millennium Declaration to the Millennium Summit, and especially in view of its reference to striving for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, the Russian delegation wishes to note that progress towards the goal of nuclear disarmament is necessary for the implementation of agreements already in existence.
We should strive for the elimination of the nuclear threat in the context of the strengthening of strategic stability.
Mr. Wang Donghua (China) (spoke in Chinese): As always, the Chinese delegation has supported you, Mr. President, in all your efforts to achieve a good draft United Nations Millennium Declaration, and the draft text we have just adopted is indeed a good one.
It is our hope that such a conference can be convened within the existing disarmament framework.
Mr. Mekprayoonthong (Thailand): We would like to express a concern of which we have spoken before regarding paragraph 9, bullet 10.
We would have preferred the words “especially by making arms transfers more transparent and supporting regional disarmament measures” to have been deleted.
Mr. Apata (Nigeria): Speaking on behalf of the Nigerian delegation and of the Group of 77, I wish to express our sincere appreciation to you, Mr. President, and to congratulate you and your team on your outstanding work on the draft United Nations Millennium Declaration, a text of which we can all be proud and which undoubtedly will stand the test of time.
I want only to add my suggestion that the delegations that have indicated reservations here and there should please reconsider, because this declaration will be adopted at the summit level.
I make a special appeal to them to waive such reservations; this is a draft Declaration that we should all endorse because we are in a new millennium.
Ms. Álvarez Núñez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): I wish first of all, Mr. President, to thank you and your team for your efforts to formulate a document worthy of being referred to the Millennium Summit.
We consider that the draft Declaration is for the most part well balanced.
Despite the varied perceptions of the United Nations and its role in the world, which we have again seen reflected in recent debates, the text has succeeded in gaining mostly positive assessments, with only a few potential reservations.
I am pleased to say again that Cuba has no reservations about the draft resolution we have just adopted.
We are pleased that the draft Declaration reaffirms our faith in the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.
We agree that support for multilateralism should result in all States sharing responsibility for the conduct of international relations in the new century.
Cuba remains a steadfast defender of respect for international law.
We would have liked to see a clearer distinction between poverty eradication on the one hand and development on the other, and we note that references to the interdependence and indivisibility of human rights are absent from the section on human rights, democracy and good governance.
Strengthening the United Nations in the twenty-first century is undoubtedly an important step towards attaining the goals and commitments set out in the draft Declaration.
Like any other work of human endeavour, the draft Declaration could be improved.
But we join the consensus in the spirit of flexibility and compromise that characterizes Cuba's activities in the United Nations and its relations with all States that cherish peace and solidarity.
We will, however, submit a formal reservation, to be placed on the record of the United Nations, with regard to the second bullet in paragraph 26. Mr. Franco (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I should like first if all to congratulate you, Mr. President, and your team on this excellent draft Declaration, and on the outstanding work done to come up with a document that, in the opinion of my delegation, is very satisfactory.
Colombia is completely satisfied with every paragraph.
However, we would like to place on record that my delegation entered into consultations in good faith on the possibility of including a reference to the entry into force of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. We regret that this was not included in the draft Declaration.
The President: I should now like to express my very sincere thanks to Ambassador Gert Rosenthal of Guatemala and Ambassador Michael John Powles of New Zealand, as well as to other collaborators, for their time, excellence, patience and understanding.
All of them were very helpful to me and made invaluable contributions to the draft Declaration.
I am sure that members of the General Assembly join me in extending to them our appreciation.
I now call on the representative of Kuwait, who wishes to speak in exercise of the right of reply.
Mr. Al-Awdi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): My delegation has no wish to speak at great length.
We are pleased that the Assembly has adopted the draft United Nations Millennium Declaration, and we congratulate you, Mr. President, on that text.
At the same time, my delegation wishes to reply to comments made by the Iraqi delegation, which referred to Kuwait as the “agent” of certain States.
This is Iraq's style of dealing with Kuwait.
We simply work together with all other members of the Assembly and express our views.
Iraq accuses us and other countries of arrogance.
More than 180 countries have adopted the Millennium Declaration, but Iraq insists that Kuwait has no right to express its views.
The delegation of Iraq continues its practice of offering its own views but not wishing to hear from Kuwait.
We reject that, along with the accusation that we are arrogant.
My delegation affirms that no State has the right to drag Kuwait into matters that are none of its concern.
We are a sovereign country and certainly have the right to express our views.
The President: May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude its consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 49?
It was so decided.
Agenda item 38 (continued)

The President: We shall now proceed to consider the draft decision contained in paragraph 31 of the report of the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters related to the Security Council.
The Assembly will now take a decision on the draft decision contained in paragraph 31 of the report of the Open-ended Working Group.
May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt the draft decision?
The draft decision was adopted.
The President: I should like to express my sincere thanks to Ambassador John de Saram of Sri Lanka and to Ambassador Hans Dahlgren of Sweden, the two very able Vice-Chairmen of the Open-ended Working Group, who have so ably continued during this session to conduct the discussions and complex negotiations of the Working Group.
We are now into our seventh year, and I hope that, sooner rather than later, we will be able to come back to the General Assembly and receive a progress report on this matter.
I am sure members of the Assembly join me in extending to them our heartfelt appreciation.
They certainly have mine.
May I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item 38?
It was so decided.

Request for the reopening of the consideration of sub-item (g) of agenda item 99: letter from the Chairman of the Second Committee (A/54/952)
The President: Sub-item (g) of agenda item 99 is entitled “Renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership”.
Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 54/213, of 22 December 1999, I requested, by a letter dated 28 April 2000, Mr. Roble Olhaye of Djibouti, Chairman of the Second Committee, to undertake, on my behalf, consultations with Member States on the date, modalities, nature of the outcome and focus of the discussions of the second high-level dialogue on the theme of “Responding to globalization: facilitating the integration of developing countries into the world economy in the twenty-first century”.
In this connection, the General Assembly has before it a letter dated 30 June 2000 from the Chairman of the Second Committee, circulated in document A/54/952, in which he reported the results of his consultations.

Agenda item 176
Review of the problem of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in all its aspects
Draft resolution (A/54/L.88/Rev.1)
The President: I now give the floor to the representative of Ukraine to introduce draft resolution A/54/L.88/Rev.1.
Mr. Kuchinsky (Ukraine): I have the honour to introduce to the General Assembly the draft resolution entitled “Review of the problem of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) in all its aspects”, contained in document A/54/L.88/Rev.1.
I am pleased to announce that this draft resolution has been sponsored by over 70 delegations representing all regions of the world.
I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to the sponsors and to all delegations whose constructive participation in the informal consultations resulted in the consensus text of this draft resolution.
I want to stress that HIV/AIDS, we are convinced, is an epidemic of global proportions with enormous human and social ramifications that go far beyond the province of health alone.
The issue of HIV/AIDS has already been taken up at different international forums, both within the United Nations system and outside.
It is encouraging that this increased attention to the problem of AIDS has started to bring in the first positive results.
At the same time, it is absolutely clear that only the concerted and coordinated efforts of the international community will be able to successfully address the problem of HIV/AIDS.
My country, which has also been hit by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, spreading at an alarming rate in recent years, believes that it is high time for the United Nations to elaborate a comprehensive agenda for action against this epidemic.
The General Assembly should, in our view, play the central role in resolving this issue of global concern.
We do believe that the draft resolution that is now before us is intended to start this process.
It will enable the General Assembly to make its significant contribution to the struggle of the international community against AIDS by convening the special session, which, in our view, is the most appropriate forum for this purpose.
The main goal of this draft resolution is stated in its first operative paragraph: to convene a special session of the General Assembly as soon as possible, preferably in May 2001, but not later than the end of its fifty-sixth regular session, in order to review and address the problem of HIV/AIDS in all its aspects, as well as to coordinate and intensify international efforts to combat it.
Draft resolution A/54/L.88/Rev.1 reflects the deep concern of the international community over the accelerating spread of human immunodeficiency virus, which has already infected millions of people worldwide, and over the resulting increase in cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
The draft resolution also urges Member States and observers to ensure their representation at the special session at a high political level.
To properly arrange this crucial event, the draft envisages that the exact date of the special session, as well as the modalities, participation in and organization of the preparatory process and of the special session itself should be finalized, at the earliest opportunity, at its fifty-fifth session.
For this purpose, it proposes to include in the agenda of its fifty-fifth session the item entitled “Review of the problem of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in all its aspects”.
In conclusion, allow me to express my sincere hope that draft resolution A/54/L.88/Rev.1 will gain the broadest possible support and will be adopted by the General Assembly by consensus.
The President: I now give the floor to the representative of France, speaking on behalf of the European Union.
The challenge of the AIDS epidemic is dreadful in its brutality and breadth.
Attention needs to be focused upon it.
We know that this can only be done if all the people concerned, at the local, national, regional and international levels, are fully committed through joint and coordinated efforts and actions.
The United Nations and the General Assembly of its Member States, in particular, is an irreplaceable forum in this respect.
This is the reason for the support of the European Union for this draft resolution at this session of the United Nations General Assembly.
The European Union hopes that, as of the first weeks of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, a concentrated and effective preparatory process will allow all delegations to decide together on the ways and means of participating in this session and in its organization.
Thus, we will have to decide upon the appropriate timing for the holding of this session.
It is firm, because it establishes the objective of not being deferred beyond September 2002. It is realistic, because we all know that, as of now, the year 2001 is already heavily burdened with high-level meetings and the preparatory procedures which will relate to essential subjects — the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, follow-up to the World Summit for Children, the World Conference on Racism and the follow-up to the Second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements, and so forth.
The European Union wishes to thank the authors of the draft resolution — Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Nigeria, Ukraine and Zimbabwe.
Finally, the European Union also wishes to thank all of those delegations who have worked most constructively and transparently throughout the informal sessions towards working out a consensus.
The President: I now call on the representative of the Sudan.
Mr. Rahmtalla (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I have taken the floor to correct an error in paragraph 1 of the draft resolution which we are about to adopt, because the Arabic text of this paragraph indicates that it would be preferable if this session took place in May 2000.
The President: I call on the representative of Kenya.
Mr. Adawa (Kenya): My delegation cannot remain silent on this draft resolution.
It is unfortunate that the name of Kenya does not appear in the sponsorship of this draft when it is actually effectively participating in the very process that initiated the issue and the ideas on this matter.
At the same time, my delegation cannot remain silent on the draft knowing that the adverse, negative impact of HIV/AIDS has actually eroded the very socio-economic gains made by the developing countries, in Africa in particular, and Kenya.
It is in this context that my delegation has co-sponsored the draft and fully supports all that is indicated in it.
The President: The situation is being rectified.
I will shortly read out the list of the additional sponsors.
I now give the floor to the representative of Côte d'Ivoire.
Mr. Ahipeaud Guebo (Côte d'Ivoire) (spoke in French): Côte d'Ivoire would like to be included as a sponsor of the resolution under consideration.
The President: We have heard the last speaker in the debate on this item.
We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution A/54/L.88/Rev.1.
These are the names of the additional co-sponsors of the draft resolution: Guatemala, Malta, Russian Federation, Slovakia, United States of America, Belarus, Iceland, the Netherlands, Liechtenstein, Myanmar, Haiti, Suriname, Kenya, Algeria, Côte d'Ivoire, Cameroon.
Ms. Gras (France) (spoke in French): Looking at the documents submitted today by the Secretariat, I note that you have just now orally added the Netherlands as sponsor.
None of the names of the other member States of the European Union appear, although all 15 of us are sponsors of the draft resolution.
It seems there is a difference between the French and English versions of the document.
Mr. Jin (Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services): On this issue, we have taken note of the statement of the French delegation, and will ensure that the necessary correction is made in the French version.
With regard to the statement of programme budget implications in connection with draft resolution A/54/L.88/Rev.1, I wish to draw the attention of the General Assembly to the following.
In view of the fact that the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions and the Fifth Committee could not meet as the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly is due to conclude today, the programme budget implications will be presented for examination and decision by the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session.
Mr. Sabo (Niger) (spoke in French): The Niger delegation wishes with other delegations to join the list of co-sponsors to draft resolution A/54/L.88/Rev.1 relating to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
The President: May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/54/L.88/Rev.1?
The draft resolution was adopted (resolution 54/283).
The President: I should like to remind delegations that the following agenda items, on which action has been taken at previous meetings, have remained open for consideration during the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly: Items 10, 11, 15, 17, 20, 27, 37, 42 to 44, 46 to 48, 50, 97, 101, 106, 110, 116, 117 to 121, 123 to 133, 136, 137, 141 to 151, 160, 163, 164, 166, 169, 172, 173 and 175.
As members are aware, these items, with the exception of sub-item (b) of agenda item 101 entitled “Economic and technical cooperation among developing countries”, item 123 entitled “Joint Inspection Unit”, item 150 entitled “Financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone”, and item 163 entitled “Review of the implementation of General Assembly resolution 48/218 B”, have been included in the provisional agenda of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly.
May I take it that the Assembly considers that discussion of these items at the present session is concluded?
It is so decided.
Closing address by the President
The President: Distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, we have now come to the end of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly, and it is time for me now to prepare handing over the gavel to my worthy successor.
It was the first-ever session of the General Assembly which straddled two centuries and two millenniums.
Foremost among the most memorable things was the responsibility for preparing for the unprecedented United Nations Millennium Summit of heads of State or Government.
The world will be witnessing the largest gathering of world leaders.
This is really making history, and the final declaration will put meat on the bones.
We held three special sessions.
The first one was held in September last year, on small island developing States and their special needs.
And the other two took place in June this year, one as a follow-up to the Fourth World Conference on Women, held at Beijing in 1995, and the other as a follow-up to the World Summit for Social Development, held at Copenhagen in 1995; these two special sessions took place in New York and in Geneva respectively.
All three special sessions adopted action-oriented declarations and platforms for implementation, taking into consideration the outstanding progress already achieved by Member States and other key international and national stakeholders.
I recommend that the fifth-fifth session of the General Assembly pay close attention to these important outcome documents and give effect to their recommendations.
Once again, it proved impossible for Member States to resolve the major sticking points, among them the admission of new permanent members, the exercise of the veto and some problematic procedural matters.
There has, however, been some noticeable progress as regards the working methods of the Security Council.
The Council has begun opening up its meetings to the other United Nations Member States as well as interacting informally with non-governmental organizations.
This openness and flexibility must be encouraged.
The fundamental problem seems to be a manifest lack of political will on the part of some permanent members.
In the light of this gridlock, which is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future, I am of the view that we should revisit the fixed position of a “package deal”.
There are some new and creative ideas to move the debate forward.
In the meantime, I hope that the growing sense of urgency among a large number of States about the need to reform, enlarge and democratize the Security Council will be embraced by all.
I invite representatives to carefully study the latest report of the aforementioned working group.
It contains practical proposals on the way forward.
Moreover, pursuant to General Assembly resolutions 53/92 and 54/234, I established a working group to operationalize the implementation of the Secretary-General's recommendations contained in his 1998 report on the causes of conflict and the consequences thereof in Africa.
The working group has submitted specific proposals to overcome any bottlenecks, taking into account the outstanding recommendations of the Economic and Social Council.
Those proposals are attached to the report that is now before the fifth-fifth session of the Assembly.
On another, but related, issue, the Assembly also decided to convene in 2001 a critical intergovernmental conference on financing for development.
This is a topical subject which is today at the core of the current debate on development, poverty eradication, debt cancellation, full employment and prosperity for all.
I see it in the context of a global challenge which hinges on both political will and resource mobilization, something which I have talked about.
In this context, I undertook setting up a bureau of the preparatory committee for that conference, and its planning activities have commenced in earnest.
The participation in the forthcoming high-level conference by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, the United Nations Development Programme and other actors is indispensable from the word go.
We need such partnerships in order to fulfil the goals and development plans of the United Nations.
I commend the General Assembly for having launched what I consider to be a people-driven rescue operation.
The United Nations Millennium Summit will start tomorrow in this Hall.
It will indeed be a historic moment both for the United Nations and for humanity at large.
By the time the general debate starts next week, we will be celebrating its outcome and paying tribute to the world leaders for their collective will for world peace, cooperation and development and for their reaffirmation of support for the United Nations.
It was my privilege to have presided over the preparations for the Millennium Summit, and I want to thank all delegations for their cooperation in bringing the preparations to a successful conclusion.
During the course of my presidency, I remained faithful to the mandate of the General Assembly, consistent with the United Nations Charter.
I tried to give equal importance to all the agenda items and to those issues that came up from different sources, within the context of the mandate given to the Assembly.
I will elaborate on them on another occasion in my capacity as Namibia's Foreign Minister.
Earlier, I mentioned the protracted and frustrating United Nations reform process.
I would like to reiterate my strong views in relation, in particular, to the functions and powers of the General Assembly.
The Charter stipulates in various places encompassing and indisputable functions and powers of the Assembly.
These qualities have been further enlarged significantly by subsequent United Nations resolutions and decisions, not excluding the role of the General Assembly in the field of peacekeeping and peace enforcement.
During the past 12 months, I personally witnessed the extent to which the authority and integrity of the General Assembly continued to become the object of denigration as a way of currying favour with the other organs.
I expressed my concerns on this subject in my acceptance speech last year.
It is high time for the Member States, particularly the developing countries, to redress the persistent attacks on and marginalization of this foremost organ of the United Nations, the General Assembly.
From 1960 onwards, the membership of the United Nations has grown by leaps and bounds, and now stands at 188.
Today, it will become 189.
The General Assembly is unlike any other body: it is the most representative, democratic, transparent and deliberative policy-making organ of all the United Nations.
The real business starts here and ends here.
This is one of the burning issues so close to my heart, and I will deal with it later.
That is what I came for: nothing more, nothing less.
But the General Assembly endures.
And that is my imprimatur.
I am not the first, and I will definitely not be the last, to renew the call for closer and more regularized cooperation, coordination and action among the principal officers of the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council and the Secretariat.
Such institutionalized, routinized and sustained interaction at the highest levels of our Organization will reinforce its capacity to measure success and ensure cost-effectiveness and efficiency throughout the system.
This is absolutely vital at a time when rapidly changing international circumstances and challenges require one vision, one voice and joint action through the principal organs of the United Nations.
I have not forgotten the others, but these four are at the centre of the day-to-day activities of our Organization.
The United Nations faces challenging times in this century.
One of the best ways to ensure its efficacy and performance is for it to be provided with sufficient resources and assured political support.
To this end, Member States must pay their assessed and legally obligatory contributions on time, in full and without conditions.
This matter has now become a bone of serious contention with serious political repercussions indeed for the United Nations.
The current state of the Organization's finances is precarious, and a lasting solution must be found urgently.
During the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, Member States will deal once again with a lengthy agenda containing the whole gamut of critical challenges and current problems facing the United Nations.
But we know only too well, do we not, that virtually all the debilitating and critical social issues in the world were short-listed, analysed and defined in specific programmes and plans of action a long time ago.
We know this from the United Nations summits of the 1990s that sought to place before the Member States matters of public policy prioritizing and financing for development by the international community.
The goals of that people-centred agenda remain intact.
They are summed up in the words peace, development, resource mobilization and human security.
If there is determined political will backed up by adequate financial resources, the developing countries and their poor masses will be well placed to deal effectively with the problems of education for all, gender equality, health care, childcare, poverty eradication, rural development, clean water and infrastructure building.
I am saying that we all know exactly what the problems, needs and priorities of the poor are.
What has been in short supply is the delivery of resources to engender sustainable social development.
Over the last year, I spoke up at every opportunity on the heart-wrenching topic of the suffering of and deliberate violence against the world's children, especially those trapped in armed conflict.
I, together with so many other committed co-workers throughout the world, have tried to help sensitize the international community.
I have used my office to raise the profile of this issue higher.
I want to pay tribute to all United Nations agencies, organizations, offices and individuals the world over who have become part and parcel of this noble crusade.
Their efforts to ensure a better, safer and more humane place for the sake of the leaders of the future and the repositories of human civilization — our children — will sustain this most sacred cause.
Our children are tomorrow's champions of dialogue, not of the clash of world civilizations, which make us different but yet unite us in diversity.
We swim together or we sink together: the choice is ours.
But saving children must come first.
The General Assembly this year adopted a new Optional Protocol to the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child.
This welcome achievement will further assist in the betterment of the welfare of children, their protection from child labour, from sexual exploitation, from destructive wars and from shameful pornography.
While I am encouraged by the growing commitment by the Member States of the United Nations to safeguard and promote the well-being of children, quite a lot still remains to be done.
The General Assembly must continue to remain vigilant in protecting our children and blame and shame by name and place their tormentors and accomplices.
One of the most urgent challenges today is that of putting the needs of the people at the centre of the global agenda of peace and development and democracy.
This is what I said in Geneva during the closing ceremony of the special session on social development.
We must summon all the necessary political will, mobilize the requisite resources and focus on people-centred priorities to defeat poverty, hunger, want and fear from the face of the Earth once and for all.
Compassion, generosity and sharing are noble virtues that should govern human relations.
While the United Nations is not a perfect Organization, it is the only true, universal and representative international common home we have.
It is here, and nowhere else, that we can together ensure world peace and development for the benefit of all.
This must be our common hope and expectation from the United Nations Millennium Summit, which starts tomorrow in this majestic Hall of States and “We the Peoples”.
I have a long roster of wonderful people to thank.
I will happily do that in the fullness of time.

Tribute to the memory of the late Permanent Representative of Saint Kitts and Nevis to the United Nations, His Excellency Mr. Lee Llewellyn Moore
The Acting President: It is my sad duty to inform members of the passing of one of our colleagues, Mr. Lee Llewellyn Moore, the Permanent Representative of Saint Kitts and Nevis to the United Nations since 1995.
Ambassador Moore had a long and distinguished career as a civil servant and an esteemed diplomat, and was well respected both at home and abroad for his admirable qualities and devotion to his country and to the ideals of the United Nations.
On behalf of the General Assembly and its President, and on my own behalf, I should like to convey our heartfelt condolences to the Government and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis and to the bereaved family.
I now invite representatives to stand and observe a minute of silence in tribute to the memory of Mr. Lee Llewellyn Moore.
The members of the General Assembly observed a minute of silence.
The Acting President: I give the floor to the representative of Saint Kitts and Nevis.
Mrs. Browne (Saint Kitts and Nevis): I speak today on behalf of the Permanent Mission of Saint Kitts and Nevis.
I would like first of all to express my gratitude to you, Mr. Vice-President, for your statement and kind remarks expressed in honour of the late Sir Lee L. Moore. I am confident that he would have liked me to express appreciation for the cordial relations that he shared with the members of the Assembly and for the general spirit of cooperation that exists between our Mission and the United Nations system.
I share the Vice-President's comment that Sir Lee L. Moore had a very distinguished career: he served the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis in the fields of law, politics and diplomacy.
It was in January of this year that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II conferred upon him the title of Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George for his sterling contribution to the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis.
In his address to the Federation on the passing of Sir Lee L. Moore, The Honourable Denzil Douglas, Prime Minister of the Federation, stated, “The Federation has lost yet another of its illustrious sons”. I join The Honourable Prime Minister in saying that the Permanent Mission of Saint Kitts and Nevis mourns the loss of a remarkable diplomat.
The mortal remains of Sir Lee L. Moore will be laid to rest in Saint Kitts and Nevis at a State funeral on Friday, 19 May.
A memorial service will be held in his honour in New York at a date to be announced.
I would also like to inform the Assembly that a book of condolences will be open for signature at the Permanent Mission of Saint Kitts and Nevis tomorrow, Thursday, 11 May, and on Friday, 12 May, between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. I take this opportunity also to thank representatives who have already conveyed expressions of condolences.
Agenda item 125 (continued)
Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations (A/54/730/Add.5)
The Acting President: In the letter contained in document A/54/730/Add.5, the Secretary-General informs the President of the General Assembly that since the issuance of his communications contained in document A/54/730 and addenda 1 to 4, Mali has made the necessary payment to reduce its arrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the Charter.
May I take it that the General Assembly duly takes note of the information contained in that document?
It was so decided.
Agenda item 17 (continued)
Appointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and other appointments
(b) Appointment of members of the Committee on Contributions
Report of the Fifth Committee (A/54/541/Add.1)

May I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to appoint the person recommended?
It was so decided.
(h) Appointment of members of the Joint Inspection Unit
Note by the President of the General Assembly (A/54/110)
The Acting President: As indicated in document A/54/110, in accordance with the procedures described in article 3, paragraph 1, of the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit, having consulted the regional groups concerned, and on the basis of the candidate submitted by the African States, as well as through a consultation by secret ballot with the General Assembly, the President of the General Assembly requested Austria, Burkina Faso, Germany and Romania to propose candidates.
As further indicated in document A/54/110, as a result of the consultations held in accordance with article 3, paragraph 2, of the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit, including consultations with the President of the Economic and Social Council and with the Secretary-General in his capacity as Chairman of the Administrative Committee on Coordination, the President of the General Assembly submits to the Assembly the candidatures of Mrs. Doris Bertrand-Muck of Austria, Mr. Ion Gorita of Romania, Mr. Wolfgang M. Münch of Germany and Mr. Louis-Dominique Ouédraogo of Burkina Faso for appointment as members of the Joint Inspection Unit for a five-year term of office beginning on 1 January 2001 and expiring on 31 December 2005.
May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to appoint those candidates?
It was so decided.
Agenda item 49 (continued)
United Nations reform: measures and proposals
(b) The Millennium Assembly of the United Nations
Draft resolution (A/54/L.83/Rev.1)
Report of the Fifth Committee (A/54/864)
The Acting President: In view of the urgency unanimously expressed by Member States that a decision on the organizational aspects of the Millennium Summit should be taken without delay, I have consulted with the Secretariat and I can advise Member States that if draft resolution A/54/L.83/Rev.1 is adopted today, it will be possible to have the drawing of lots to establish the list of speakers for the Millennium Summit on Friday, 26 May, in the morning.
Before we proceed to consider draft resolution A/54/L.83/Rev.1, I should like to submit to members some oral revisions to the draft resolution.
The first revision is to the second paragraph of the preambular part.
The first line of the second preambular paragraph should read:
“Recalling also its resolution 54/254 of 15 March 2000, in which it:”.
At the beginning of subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c), add the words “Decided that”.
After subparagraph (c), add the following subparagraph, taken from paragraph 4 of resolution 54/254 of 15 March 2000:
“(d) Requested the President of the General Assembly to hold consultations with all Member States in an open-ended process with a view to taking decisions on all outstanding issues relating to the Millennium Summit, including its outcome.”
The next revision concerns part A of the annex.
Paragraph 4 (a) of part A of the annex would be substituted by the following:
“(a) Heads of State will thus be accorded first priority, followed by heads of Government; vice-presidents, crown princes/princesses; the highest-ranking official of the Holy See and Switzerland, in their capacity as observer States, and Palestine, in its capacity as observer; ministers; and permanent representatives.”
That is the end of the revisions.
With regard to paragraph 2 of part B of the annex, in particular the last sentence, which reads:
“The choice of chairperson of the fourth round table will be subject to further consultations”,
I should like to assure the Assembly that the President will consult the interested parties concerned, notably the two other regional groups, in the choice of the chairperson of the fourth round table.
The President has also asked me to let the Assembly know that he will inform the representative of the country of the President of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly about the preparations for the Millennium Summit.
It is the view of the President that this will help facilitate the smooth and successful co-chairmanship of the Millennium Summit.
The President has discussed his intentions with the Permanent Representative of Finland, who has expressed her satisfaction in that regard.
We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution A/54/L.83/Rev.1, as orally revised.
I shall now call on those representatives who wish to speak in explanation of position before action is taken on the draft resolution.
May I remind delegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.
Mr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): The draft resolution on the organization of the list of speakers and the round tables for the Millennium Summit reflects to a large extent the views expressed by various delegations on procedural matters relating to the Summit.
We would, however, like to be quite clear about a number of provisions in the draft.
First, we support the proposal that the draft should clearly set forth the order of statements to be made at the Summit, on the understanding that priority will be given to heads of State and then heads of Government, vice-presidents and so forth.
In this connection, we note that this idea is reflected in the amendments that have just been read out to us.
The second point relates to paragraph 2, subparagraph (b), of part A, which provides that consultations will continue regarding the possible participation by one or more representatives of intergovernmental organizations, parliaments and civil society.
In this connection, it is our understanding that none of the Member States would object to the participation at the Summit by representatives of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
Thus we consider that this question in principle is settled, and that further consultations will relate only to participation by other invitees, as referred to in paragraph 2, subparagraph (b).
Lastly, we deem it important that after the adoption of this draft resolution, the focus of our work should be shifted immediately to preparations for the outcome, the final document of the Summit, as provided for in resolution 54/254.
We reaffirm our willingness to cooperate constructively with all delegations and, of course, with the President of the General Assembly, with a view to reaching agreement on an important political declaration of the Summit.
Mr. Sun (Republic of Korea): I would like to support the oral revision that you, Sir, proposed with regard to paragraph 4 (a) of annex A of the draft resolution.
My delegation believes that the paragraph as revised is in conformity with the letter and spirit of the well-established practice of the General Assembly.
The Acting President: I would like to thank you very much for your support.
We have heard the last speaker in explanation of position before action is taken.
I call on the representative of Venezuela on a point of order.
Mr. Herrera Marcano (Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): I want to point out a substantive discrepancy between the English and Spanish versions of the draft resolution on which we are about to take a decision, in the second sentence of paragraph 2 of annex B.
The Acting President: The Assembly will now take a decision on draft resolution A/54/L.83/Rev.1, entitled “Organization of the list of speakers and the round tables for the Millennium Summit”, as orally revised.
May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/54/L.83/Rev.1, as orally revised?
Draft resolution A/54/L.83/Rev.1, as orally revised, was adopted (resolution 54/261).
The Acting President: I shall now call on those representatives who wish to speak in explanation of position on the resolution just adopted.
May I remind delegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.
Mr. Tello (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): My delegation welcomes the adoption of this resolution, which at last allows us to move from consideration of procedural matters to debating the substantive aspects of the Millennium Summit.
In this connection, we respectfully request that there be prepared and distributed a timetable of meetings for the consideration of the Secretary-General's report to the Summit.
Those meetings should be scheduled to begin as soon as possible, so that the outcome or outcomes that are to be adopted in September by our heads of State or Government can be prepared.
This resolution, together with the decision adopted this morning by the Fifth Committee, makes it perfectly clear that we are preparing for the holding of a single event - a unique and singular event to which our heads of State or Government have been personally invited by the Secretary-General.
We mention this because we are concerned that in this building's hallways we continue to hear about ongoing initiatives aimed at diminishing this solemn occasion through the holding of parallel events.
So that there will be no mistake, I will say that I am referring to the idea of having meetings at the level of heads of State or Government of the Economic and Social Council and the Security Council.
We trust that the countries that make up those two principal organs share with us the desire to ensure the greatest success and visibility of the Millennium Summit.
The Acting President: I would like to welcome the observations made by the representative of Mexico and to assure him that the President has informed me that, when he returns during the week of 22 May, he intends to hold consultations with the Secretary-General with a view to establishing a timetable so as to have successful preparations and to implement the decisions taken today.
Mr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): We are extraordinarily pleased that the General Assembly has been able to adopt this resolution at this time, after 18 months of consultations and numerous meetings.
As we stated on 27 April of this year, the fact that we have been able to adopt these important decisions puts us in an excellent position to undertake the most important part of the preparations for this summit.
The Millennium Summit will not go down in history - or fail to do so - on the basis of the procedures and modalities of its organization, but on the basis of the expressions of political will by the Member States and of the commitments undertaken and results achieved.
In this connection, the delegation of Cuba greatly welcomes the fact that, with the adoption of this resolution, we have concluded the lengthy stage of organizational decisions, despite the fact that during this morning's meeting of the Fifth Committee, we raised a number of issues on points that were open to interpretation in connection with technical aspects or inaccuracies relating to the budgetary aspects of this resolution.
In our opinion, the most important requirement is that the President of the General Assembly be able immediately to announce a timetable of intergovernmental consultations on the substantive issues to be considered by the Summit.
We welcome the explanation that you, Sir, have just given, but we would also like to point out that if the consultations with the regional groups are to begin on 22 May in order to determine the way in which the intergovernmental process is going to take place, it will be very difficult to accomplish that goal before June, which is less than two months before that important universal event.
Our delegation would like the General Assembly immediately to begin to consider the important report of the Secretary-General and other inputs that are no less important, such as the communiqué of the annual ministerial meeting in Cartagena or the documents adopted during the recent South Summit.
Our delegation believes that the Millennium Summit will be a unique meeting of the General Assembly that should have no competition from other parallel events or initiatives that, albeit inadvertently, might have unwanted consequences and diminish the impact of the Summit or undermine the importance of a summit meeting of the most representative and universal body of the United Nations - the General Assembly, whose powers should be wielded fully and should not be diminished.
The Acting President: The observations of the Permanent Representative of Cuba will be duly conveyed to the President.
Mr. Schumacher (Germany): I would like to associate myself with the comments of previous speakers.
I would also like to refer to the rumours continuing to circulate in the corridors about planned summits, in connection with the Millennium Summit, of two other United Nations organs, namely, the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council.
It is certainly not for us to infringe upon the responsibilities of those main organs of the United Nations.
The Security Council and the Economic and Social Council are certainly entitled to hold meetings at their discretion, whenever they consider it necessary.
However, as we see it, the Secretary-General initially brought forward the idea of a Millennium Assembly of the United Nations in order to convey to the world the message of a family of nations, standing together, shoulder to shoulder, to master the challenges of the century that is beginning.
We are afraid that this message might be diluted if it develops into a more or less regular event involving summit meetings by one, two or three main organs of the United Nations.
We would like to draw the attention of the President to these rumours and would very much appreciate it if consultations could take place with the other organs of the United Nations to make sure that we are about to come together to bring our heads of State to an event which will truly reflect the response of this body to the challenges ahead.
The Acting President: The observations of the representative of Germany have been duly noted.
We have heard the last speaker in explanation of position.
Further to my earlier comments in response to the statement made by the Permanent Representative of Mexico, I wish to confirm to the Assembly that the President will convene a meeting of the General Assembly during the week of 22 May to allow Member States to have an exchange of views on the report of the Secretary-General entitled, “We the peoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century”.
We have thus concluded this stage of our consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 49.
The meeting rose at 4.10 p.m.

In the absence of the President, Mr. Ingólfsson (Iceland), Vice-President, took the Chair.
The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.
Agenda item 125 (continued)
Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations (A/54/730/Add.6)
The Acting President: In the letter contained in document A/54/730/Add.6, the Secretary-General informs the President of the General Assembly that, since the issuance of his communications contained in document A/54/730 and addenda 1 to 5, Burkina Faso has made the necessary payment to reduce its arrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the Charter.
May I take it that the General Assembly duly takes note of the information contained in that document?
It was so decided.
Agenda item 8 (continued)
Adoption of the agenda and organization of work: reports of the General Committee
Fourth report of the General Committee (A/54/250/Add.3)
The Acting President: In its fourth report, the General Committee decided to recommend to the General Assembly that an additional item, entitled “Review of the problem of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in all its aspects”, should be included in the agenda of the current session.
May I take it that the General Assembly decides to include in the agenda of the current session this additional item?
It was so decided.
The Acting President: The General Committee further decided to recommend to the General Assembly that the additional item should be considered directly in plenary meeting.
May I take it that the General Assembly decides to consider this item directly in plenary meeting?
It was so decided.
Agenda items 8 and 167 (continued)
Adoption of the agenda and organization of work: reopening of the consideration of agenda item 167
Cooperation between the United Nations and the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization
The Acting President: Members will recall that agenda item 167 was closed at the 70th plenary meeting, held on 6 December 1999.
The item, which was closed inadvertently, should have remained open for consideration during the fifty-fourth session, in the light of the last paragraph of resolution 54/65.
In that paragraph, the General Assembly invites the Secretary-General to take the appropriate steps to conclude with the Executive Secretary of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty an agreement to regulate the relationship between the United Nations and the Preparatory Commission, to be submitted to the General Assembly for its approval.
May I take it, therefore, that the Assembly agrees that agenda item 167, entitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization”, remains open for consideration during the fifty-fourth session?
It was so decided.
Agenda item 106 (continued)
Social development, including questions relating to the world social situation and to youth, ageing, disabled persons and the family
Draft resolution (A/54/L.85)
The Acting President: Members will recall that, at its 3rd plenary meeting on 17 September 1999, the General Assembly decided to allocate agenda item 106 to the Third Committee.
Members will also recall that the item remained open for consideration during the fifty-fourth session.
In order for the General Assembly to proceed expeditiously on the item, may I take it that the General Assembly wishes to consider agenda item 106 directly in plenary meeting?
It was so decided.
The Acting President: May I further take it that the Assembly agrees to proceed immediately to the consideration of agenda item 106?
As I hear no objection, we shall now proceed accordingly.
In connection with agenda item 106, the General Assembly has before it a draft resolution issued as document A/54/L.85.
The Assembly will now take a decision on draft resolution A/54/L.85, entitled “Follow-up to the International Year of Older Persons: Second World Assembly on Ageing”.
I give the floor to the representative of the Secretariat.
Mr. Jin (Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services): I wish to inform Member States that, should the General Assembly adopt draft resolution A/54/L.85, under operative paragraph 1 of the draft resolution, the General Assembly would decide to convene a Second World Assembly on Ageing in 2002 devoted to an overall review of the outcome of the First World Assembly on Ageing, as well as to the adoption of a revised plan of action and a long-term strategy on ageing.
Implementation of the requests contained in this operative paragraph, in particular the costs for the convening of the Second World Assembly on Ageing, would be included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003.
In operative paragraph 3, the General Assembly would accept the offer of the Government of Spain and decide that the Second World Assembly on Ageing would be held in Spain in April 2002.
Should the General Assembly accept the offer of the Government of Spain to host the Second World Assembly on Ageing, in accordance with paragraph 5 of General Assembly resolution 40/243, the difference in costs between New York and Spain would be borne by the host Government.
In operative paragraph 6, the Commission for Social Development would serve as the preparatory committee for the Second World Assembly on Ageing and be open to participation of all Member States of the United Nations, members of the specialized agencies and observers, in accordance with the established practice of the General Assembly.
There is provision in the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 for substantive and conference servicing of the Commission for Social Development at its thirty-ninth and fortieth sessions.
The provision contained in operative paragraph 6 would imply the servicing of two sessions of the preparatory committee, one in 2001 and the other 2002, and would require the provision of conference servicing, including interpretation in all six languages, the translation, editing and publishing of the associated documentation in all of the languages, estimated at $169,000 per session.
Provision has been made in the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 not only for meetings programmed at the time of the budget preparation, but also for meetings authorized subsequently, provided that the number and distribution of meetings are consistent with the pattern of meetings of past years.
Consequently, no additional resources would be needed for the conference servicing for the meetings of the preparatory committee in 2001.
The resource requirements for the preparatory committee in 2002 would be included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003.
Under operative paragraphs 8 and 9, the Secretary-General would be invited to establish a technical committee, funded through voluntary contributions and composed of experts geographically balanced to assist in the formulation of proposals during the preparatory process.
In operative paragraph 12, the General Assembly would encourage voluntary contributions to the Trust Fund on Ageing to support preparatory activities of the Second World Assembly, including the participation of least developed countries.
The requests contained in operative paragraphs 8 and 12 will be carried out through funding from voluntary contributions.
It is anticipated that voluntary contributions will be forthcoming to support the requests.
As regards the use of voluntary contributions to support the participation of least developed countries in the Second World Assembly, it should be noted that this would imply an exception to the provision of General Assembly resolution 1798 (XVII) of 11 December 1962 on the payment of travel and subsistence allowances to members of organs and subsidiary organs of the United Nations.
In addition, it is the understanding of the Secretariat that the support to be provided to least developed countries would consist of the payment from extra-budgetary resources of the travel cost for one representative from each least developed country to attend the Second World Assembly.
In summary, should the General Assembly adopt the draft resolution, no additional requirements would arise under the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001.
The Acting President: May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/54/L.85?
Draft resolution A/54/L.85 was adopted (resolution 54/262).
The Acting President: The Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item 106.
Agenda item 116 (continued)
Human rights questions
Draft resolution (A/54/L.84)
The Acting President: Members will recall that, at its 3rd plenary meeting on 17 September 1999, the General Assembly decided to allocate agenda item 116 to the Third Committee.
Members will also recall that the item remained open for consideration during the fifty-fourth session.
In order for the General Assembly to proceed expeditiously on the item, may I take it that the General Assembly wishes to consider agenda item 116 directly in plenary meeting?
It was so decided.
The Acting President: May I further take it that the Assembly agrees to proceed immediately to the consideration of agenda item 116?
As I hear no objection, we shall now proceed accordingly.
In connection with agenda item 116, the General Assembly has before it a draft resolution issued as document A/54/L.84.
The Assembly will now take a decision on draft resolution A/54/L.84, entitled “Optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict and on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography”.
May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/54/L.84?
Draft resolution A/54/L.84 was adopted (resolution 54/263).
The Acting President: Before giving the floor to speakers in explanation of vote after the vote, may I remind delegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.
Ms. Batoréu (Portugal): The European Union welcomes the adoption today by the General Assembly of the two optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child: on the involvement of children in armed conflict and on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.
We hope that those two legal instruments will become important tools for the promotion and protection of the human rights of all children around the world.
The optional protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, which implements some fundamental principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, represents a significant step towards improving the standards of protection accorded to children against those heinous practices of exploitation. Our goal is to eliminate those practices, and we stand ready to support further efforts to combat any practices that violate the rights of the child in this field.
The optional protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict also constitutes a fundamental complement to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and especially so at a time when we are experiencing an increasing number of armed conflicts in which children are increasingly targeted and brutalized, with very negative consequences for their living conditions and for their enjoyment of their human rights.
The European Union would like to extend to all those who participated in the work of the two drafting groups its appreciation for the remarkable spirit of cooperation and the constructive approach they demonstrated, which allowed us to achieve this successful outcome.
The European Union hopes that these two optional protocols will be subject to early entry into force.
Mr. Hedman (Sweden): Having just joined the consensus on the adoption of draft resolution A/54/L.84, on the question of optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict and on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, Sweden would like, in addition to the European Union statement, make its position clear as to how we understand article 2 (c) of the optional protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.
First, Sweden understands the word “representation” in the definition of child pornography in article 2 (c) to cover only visual representation.
Secondly, still regarding article 2 (c), Sweden interprets “any representation, by whatever means, of a child engaged in real or simulated explicit sexual activities” not to be applicable to adults acting, posing or dressing as a child.
The Acting President: We have heard the last speaker in explanation of vote after the vote.
The Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item 116.
Agenda item 90 (continued)
Comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects
Report of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) (A/54/577/Add.l)
The Acting President: I request the Rapporteur of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee), Mr. Gualberto Rodríguez San Martín of Bolivia, to introduce the report of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee.
Mr. Rodríguez San Martín (Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): It is my great pleasure to introduce the report of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) on agenda item 90, entitled “Comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects”, contained in document A/54/577/Add.1, for consideration and approval by the General Assembly.
As members may recall, by its resolution 54/81 of 6 December 1999, the General Assembly requested the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations to submit a report on its work to the Assembly at its fifty-fourth session.
The Special Political and Decolonization Committee resumed consideration of agenda item 90 at its 25th meeting, held on 22 May 2000.
The Committee had before it the report of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations (A/54/839).
The Special Political and Decolonization Committee also had before it a draft resolution sponsored by Argentina, Canada, Egypt, Japan, Nigeria and Poland, which it adopted at that meeting without a vote; the draft resolution appears in paragraph 9 of the report of the Committee before the Assembly this morning.
On behalf of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee), I have the honour to commend the report to the General Assembly for its consideration and approval.
The Acting President: If there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly decides not to discuss the report of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) that is before it today.
It was so decided.
The Acting President: Statements will therefore be limited to explanations of vote or position.
The positions of delegations regarding the recommendation of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee have been made clear in the Committee and are reflected in the relevant official records.
May I remind members that under paragraph 7 of decision 34/401 the Assembly agreed that
“When the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, i.e., either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, unless that delegation's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee.”
May I also remind delegations that, also in accordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.
Before we begin to take action on the recommendation contained in the report of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take a decision in the same manner as was done in the Committee, unless the Secretariat is notified to the contrary in advance.
We shall now take a decision on the draft resolution contained in paragraph 9 of the report of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee), document A/54/577/Add.1.
I call on the representative of the United States.
Ms. Healey (United States of America): We support the draft resolution before us today, which, among other things, welcomes and endorses the report of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations.
We note the valuable role of the Special Committee in identifying practical measures to enhance the capacity of the United Nations to conduct peacekeeping operations.
We would also like to thank the Chairman of the Special Committee and the Chairman of the working group for their efforts this spring.
In the light of the challenges facing United Nations peacekeeping efforts throughout the world today, we would like to underscore, as stated in the report, that
“the Special Committee considers it essential for the United Nations to be in an effective position to maintain international peace and security, inter alia, by improving the capacity to assess conflict situations, by effective planning and management of peacekeeping operations, and by responding quickly and effectively to any Security Council mandate.” (A/54/839, para.
To this end, we applaud the report's call for improving planning and management of peacekeeping operations, building capacity for rapid deployment and shortening procurement times for vital resources.
We also support the report's call for the replenishment of the logistics base in Brindisi and, in particular, the call for a comprehensive review of all elements within the Secretariat that play a role in peacekeeping operations.
We regret that the Special Committee could not reach agreement on other issues, which we believe would assist the United Nations in efficiently and effectively deploying peacekeepers.
These issues include the use of Gratis Type II Personnel, the development of a roster system and the strengthening of the standby arrangements system.
We look forward to working to build a consensus on these proposals in the future.
Peacekeeping operational reform is a top priority for my Government, and we therefore call for further discussion and work on these issues relating to peacekeeping early in the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly.
We would also consider supporting a reconvening of the Special Committee to discuss important peacekeeping issues, including the results of the Secretary-General's panel on peace operations.
The Acting President: The Assembly will now take a decision on the draft resolution recommended by the Special Political and Decolonization Committee in paragraph 9 of its report.
The Special Political and Decolonization Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote.
May I take it that the Assembly wishes to do the same?
The draft resolution was adopted (resolution 54/81 B).
The Acting President: May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item 90?
It was so decided.
The meeting rose at 10.45 a.m.
This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of speeches delivered in the other languages.
Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only.
They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room C-178.
Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.
The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.
Tribute to the memory of Hafez Al-Assad, President of the Syrian Arab Republic
The President: This afternoon, before we take up the items on our agenda, it is my sad duty to pay tribute to the memory of the late President of the Syrian Arab Republic, His Excellency Mr. Hafez Al-Assad, who passed away on Saturday, 10 June 2000.
President Assad was one of the longest-serving heads of State in the world and a key player in the Middle East peace process.
It is my sincere hope that, even with his passing, the negotiating process will move forward, on all the recognized tracks, towards a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the whole of the Middle East.
On behalf of the General Assembly, I request the representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to convey our condolences to the Government and the people of the Syrian Arab Republic and to the bereaved family of His Excellency Mr. Hafez Al-Assad.
I invite representatives to stand and observe a minute of silence in tribute to the memory of His Excellency Mr. Hafez Al-Assad.
The members of the General Assembly observed a minute of silence.
The President: I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Denis Dangue Réwaka, Permanent Representative of Gabon, who will speak on behalf of the African States.
Mr. Dangue Réwaka (Gabon) (spoke in French): Since Saturday, 10 June 2000, the Middle East and particularly Syria have been in mourning.
They have just lost one their illustrious leaders, President Hafez Al-Assad.
The unanimous tribute that has been paid to him throughout the world amply demonstrates how greatly he was appreciated, not only as a man the brutal loss of whom we are mourning today, but above all for his work, to which he unstintingly gave his strength, intelligence, heart and life.
The world will remember him as a staunch nationalist and a man capable of compromising.
His commitment to defend the interests of the Arab nation, as well as his struggle for peace, security and harmony among the countries of the region, made him an essential interlocutor in the Middle East peace process.
We have no doubt — and this is our most ardent wish — that his successor will pursue with the same resolve the dialogue that was happily commenced with a view to facilitating the consolidation of peace in the region.
The African Group, on the behalf of which I have the honour to speak, would like to convey to the bereaved family, the Government and people of Syria its most heartfelt sympathy and condolences.
The President: I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Makarim Wibisono, Permanent Representative of Indonesia, who will speak on behalf of the Asian States.
Mr. Wibisono (Indonesia): I have the honour to address this meeting in my capacity as the Chairman of the Group of Asian States for June 2000.
It was with the deepest regret that we learned of the passing of President Hafez Al-Assad of the Syrian Arab Republic, on Saturday, 10 June 2000.
President Hafez Al-Assad was a man who for three decades fought to build a strong and proud nation and to help his people fulfil their rightful destiny.
We are confident that despite his untimely demise the people of the Syrian Arab Republic will continue to move forward and fulfil President Al-Assad's vision under the leadership of the new President.
As the next generation assumes the leadership of Syria, we take comfort that Mr. Hafez Al-Assad rests in peace in his appointed place in paradise.
Now we, the Member States of the Asian Group, stand ready to assist the Syrian Arab Republic as it makes this transition and continues on the road to peace, security and development.
The President: I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Ion Botnaru, Permanent Representative of the Republic of Moldova, who will speak on behalf of the Eastern European States.
Mr. Botnaru (Republic of Moldova): We are deeply saddened by the passing, on Saturday, 10 June 2000, of His Excellency Hafez Al-Assad, President of the Syrian Arab Republic.
The Middle East lost one of the greatest Arab leaders.
History will reflect Mr. Al-Assad's career and accomplishments, the role he played in unifying his country.
A statesman dedicated to his country's greatness and to the destiny of the Arab nation, President Hafez Al-Assad has left his mark on history over the course of three decades.
The late President took important steps to finally achieve peace in the Middle East.
In recent years, especially since the Madrid Conference, he involved his country actively in the Middle East peace process with the aim of achieving a comprehensive and last peace in the region.
We sincerely hope that the people of the Syrian Arab Republic, together with the international community, will rededicate their efforts to achieve a stable peace, for which all of the region's peoples are waiting.
On behalf of the Group of Eastern European States, I would like to extend our sincere sympathy and condolences to the members of the bereaved family and to the Government and the people of Syria.
We also extend our condolences to His Excellency Ambassador Wehbe and the other members of the Syrian mission to the United Nations.
The President: I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Patrick Albert Lewis, Permanent Representative of Antigua and Barbuda, who will speak on behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean States.
Mr. Lewis (Antigua and Barbuda): I wish to offer deep and sincere condolences to the Government and people of the Syrian Arab Republic on behalf of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States in regard to the passing of President Hafez Al-Assad, the widely respected President of Syria.
It is quite clear to the world at large that President Assad's people held him in deep admiration, and were most knowledgeable of the developments that he brought about in his beloved country.
He was a man who never lost the common touch and with whom the channels of communication remained open for the citizens of his homeland.
Hafez Al-Assad was born in 1930, and his interest in public affairs became evident during the Second World War, prior to the French evacuation of Syria.
He took part in demonstrations aimed at restoring the independence and sovereignty of Syria, became head of a student committee, Lattaquié Muhafaza, and included in his political activities the struggle for Palestinian independence.
He later entered the military academy, and in 1966 was nominated Defence Minister, in addition to his post as commander of the air force.
By 1966 also he had played an outstanding role in leading the movement that led to the consolidation of the progressive positions and policies of the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party.
His rise after 1966 was meteoric, and in 1971 he was elected President of the Syrian Arab Republic, and he remained in this post until his untimely passing.
Domestically, he was a devoted husband and a loving father of five children.
Under President Hafez Al-Assad, respectability was restored to the region of the Middle East and a significant degree of stability was secured for Lebanon.
He was most instrumental in achieving peace in the region under the terms of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978).
Under President Al-Assad, the Syrian economy not only stabilized but demonstrated significant improvement.
The President devoted much attention to education and notable achievements were made in this area.
Those of us who hail from Latin America and the Caribbean are mindful of the contribution of the 12 million individuals of Syrian descent who are citizens of our countries.
We are thus knowledgeable of the fact that Hafez Al-Assad urged these descendants not to forget their Syrian origin, while also respecting the laws of the countries in which they lived and giving these countries their allegiance.
On a personal note, my country has at its Ambassador to the Middle East one of these descendants, and this fact gave President Al-Assad pride and joy in the achievements of his people in distant lands.
So the countries of my region, which are located in North, Central and South America, and in both the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, recall the passing of a notable politician and statesman, who made a remarkable contribution during his earthly existence towards the understanding of his region and in endeavouring to secure a just and lasting peace for that region.
The President: I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. António Monteiro, Permanent Representative of Portugal, who will speak on behalf of the Western European and Other States.
Mr. Monteiro (Portugal): On behalf of the Group of Western European and Other States, I would like to convey to the people and Government of the Syrian Arab Republic sincere condolences on the passing of President Hafez Al-Assad.
Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to the family of President Al-Assad.
His passing was a loss to the Syrian people, and he was much respected in the Arab world and beyond.
Allow me also to express the sincere hope of the Group of Western European and Other States that the commitment to peace that President Al-Assad made will be pursued vigorously, with the aim of achieving the ever more urgent comprehensive and lasting solution to the problems of the Middle East.
The President: I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Abdallah Baali, Permanent Representative of Algeria, who will speak on behalf of the Arab States.
Mr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in Arabic): I would have preferred not to find myself in the difficult position of having to pay tribute to such an outstanding personality as His Excellency the late President Hafez Al-Assad.
I was called by duty, after my colleagues in the Group of Arab States asked me to speak on their behalf, to pay tribute to a great Arab nationalist leader, the late President Al-Assad.
I am truly speechless, searching for words to express the sadness and consternation of the members of the Arab Group following the calamity that befell our Arab brothers and sisters in Syria.
We were shaken by the wrenching news of the death of one of our outstanding Arab leaders — one of the greatest symbols of recent Arab struggles for dignity, pride and prosperity.
The late President Al-Assad was a national leader.
He dedicated his life to the service of his country and his people.
He led Syria firmly and steadfastly on the road to building a modern State, achieving stability and enhancing national unity, solidarity and conciliation among the Syrian people.
His name was integrally connected to the Syrian struggle to liberate the Golan.
He made this his most noble objective, and no one could deflect him from it.
The late President was a unique symbol of loyalty in the unparalleled way he addressed and defended Arab and Islamic issues.
His humanity was the foundation for his outlook.
No one is unaware of his commitment to the just causes of concern to the world at large, specifically to the Arab and Islamic world and particularly to issues of liberation and decolonization.
The achievements of President Hafez Al-Assad are countless.
He is the type of man who not only friends, but enemies as well would recognize as being wise and a true, insightful statesman.
History will certainly recall his love for peace and his sincere desire to guarantee for his country, Syria, for the Arab people in general and for the Middle East region, the necessary conditions for living in peace and prosperity.
It was not strange that a leader such as he made peace in the Middle East a strategic choice, a choice to the dimensions of which he gave his full attention.
The success of his commitment has been evident ever since the drive for peace in the region began.
However, President Al-Assad died before he was able to proceed further on this road.
He has entrusted this work to those he left behind.
We hope that his soul will rest in peace, especially since he dedicated his life on Earth to the service of his people and his country.
May he dwell contentedly in heaven, having left Syria enjoying the dignity and stability we see today.
May his soul rest in the heavens, since he has left behind a generation — the best of Syrian men and women — who are loyal and faithful to the commitments he undertook, and thus who will also pursue the path towards the liberation of the Arab lands, the recovery of Syrian sovereignty in the Golan and the establishment of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.
May his family enjoy such consolation as they can.
The President: I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. James Cunningham of the United States of America, who will speak on behalf of the host country.
Mr. Cunningham (United States of America): As the representative of the host country, I wish to offer our condolences on the passing of President Hafez Al-Assad.
I would like also to extend our sympathies to his family and to all the Syrian people.
President Al-Assad stood out as a major figure in the Middle East.
He made a strategic choice for peace at Madrid in 1991, and we welcome Syria's continued commitment to that choice.
The United States strongly believes that the Syrian decision was the right one, and that Syria will continue on the path of peace that President Al-Assad started down.
President Al-Assad's strategic choice for peace reflected the compelling logic for all parties to pursue a comprehensive peace and America's willingness to work with all parties to achieve that goal.
We will continue to do everything in our power to bring a just, lasting and comprehensive peace to the Middle East.
We join the world in offering our condolences and hope that President Al-Assad's desire for peace will come to fruition as soon as possible.
The President: I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Mikhail Wehbe, Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic.
Mr. Wehbe (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): It is an hour of sorrow, especially since I have closely known the father and the great leader President Hafez Al-Assad.
Allow me, Sir, on behalf of the people and Government of the Syrian Arab Republic, to express to you our profound thanks and appreciation for your sincere words paying tribute to the leader and symbol of the Syrian Arab people, President Hafez Al-Assad.
I would also like to thank you for setting aside this time during the work of the General Assembly to share with Syria its sadness at its great tragedy.
I would also like to thank all those who kindly made statements — the Ambassadors who spoke on behalf of the regional groups and the host country, the United States of America — for their sincere words.
We would also like to express our profound appreciation to Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, for having paid a visit to our Mission and for offering his sincere condolences on the loss of our late President Hafez Al-Assad in the condolence book at the Mission.
With great bitterness and with a heart heavy with sorrow and fraught with pain, Syria on 10 June 2000 bade farewell to a great and brilliant leader, His Excellency President Hafez Al-Assad, who devoted his life first and foremost to the causes of his people and his nation and to the preservation of its pride and dignity.
His Excellency President Al-Assad spent his life struggling for the noble humanitarian values and principles for which he lived and which informed every minute of his life.
Our leader, Al-Assad, was born in the midst of the struggle of our Syrian people for liberation and independence, as well as of the struggle of all the Arab peoples, when the Arab nation was waging its most ferocious battle in order to achieve its legitimate aims of liberation and unity.
President Hafez Al-Assad was not an ordinary leader in Syrian history.
This leader was nurtured in the school of love of one's country and of sacrificing for the progress and dignity of one's country.
This earned him the trust of his people, who with conviction and renewed faith chose him as their leader and the symbol of their struggle.
During his rule, Syria enjoyed stability and progress.
Under him it built its modern cultural edifice.
He has left for his country and for the Arab nation a legacy of which we are all proud and an approach to which Syria will remain committed and will build upon in the days, months and years to come.
Our leader Al-Assad devoted himself to the service of his country, his people and his nation, and to the achievement of the lofty aims for which the Arab masses have struggled.
Every minute of his time was devoted to his country, and so were his days and nights.
He was indeed totally devoted to his country and to the Arab nation.
The words of one Arab poet are true of him:
“If he held in the palm of his hand nothing but his soul, he would readily give it.
Thus, let those who would petition God fear Him.”
The leader Al-Assad was one with his masses and the masses identified with their leader.
Days after the passing of Mr. Al-Assad, profound sadness still engulfs the people of Syria and the Arab nation, as all have noted, as well as others everywhere who love him.
The masses came out in every city and village with great spontaneity and filled the streets of Damascus with great sincerity, refusing to believe the painful news of the passing of their leader Hafez Al-Assad.
The name of Al-Assad has come to be associated with that of Syria.
His history has come to be linked to that of Syria and his status with its status.
Syria grew stronger under Al-Assad and Al-Assad grew stronger with Syria.
The late President Hafez Al-Assad established a prominent status for Syria at the international and regional levels.
On the domestic front, he pursued a comprehensive patriotic policy that was consolidated over the years by deep-rooted national unity and by social, cultural and economic achievements exceeding the bounds of imagination.
Modern Syria was built under his rule and, because of his tireless interest in the causes of the Arab nation, the leader Al-Assad exhorted Arabs to close ranks in the face of common challenges.
In this regard, his first and foremost concern was championing the causes of Arabs and the Arab nation, regaining Arab glory, achieving noble Arab objectives and settling Arab differences.
At the international level, he spared no effort in building sound relations with all countries of the world based on mutual respect and common interests and in championing the causes of right and justice.
President Al-Assad believed deeply in the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.
At every occasion, he emphasized the need to implement those purposes and principles and their embodiment in the policies of Syria.
Through his strategic thinking, President Al-Assad believed that there could be no world peace or fruitful international cooperation without international legitimacy, represented by the United Nations and its resolutions, which must be implemented with a single standard.
In this regard, under his leadership Syria was always a platform for the voice of right and justice and an advocate for the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace based on international legitimacy and the norms of international law.
Strategic peace is the option that Syria has chosen, an honourable peace that confers rights where they are due and upholds the dignity and pride of all.
It is a great honour for me to affirm that the policies of President Al-Assad and all the values that he established in the lives of our people have become our legacy and guiding light.
We are responsible for our commitment to that legacy and guide and for working to ensure their ongoing relevance.
Those who carry on the mission of President Al-Assad will seek to affirm and embody this commitment with greater progress and in defence of the causes of right and justice in our region and throughout the world.
During the past few days since the passing of Mr. Al-Assad, we have seen the sadness shared by everyone we have encountered within and without the United Nations.
The late President Al-Assad was the object of universal respect and appreciation that amply reflect his noble qualities, his honourable positions and firm belief in the causes of his people, his country and the entire world.
This has been acknowledged even by those who differed with him, because their differences did not affect their amity.
The leadership and people of Syria appreciate the solidarity of all those who stand with us in this difficult time.
Their sincere condolences are balm to our deep wounds and to our great tragedy.
In conclusion, I would ask members kindly to convey the thanks and appreciation of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic and its people for all the sincere emotions that have been expressed and our best wishes to their people and Governments for success in achieving progress and dignity.
May God have mercy on the dear departed and make paradise his abode.
Agenda item 125 (continued)
Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations (A/54/915)
The President: I should like, in keeping with the established practice, to invite the attention of the General Assembly to document A/54/915, which has been circulated in the General Assembly Hall this afternoon.
It contains a letter from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the General Assembly, in which he informs the Assembly that 35 Member States are in arrears in the payment of their financial contributions to the United Nations within the terms of Article 19 of the Charter.
I should like to remind delegations that, under Article 19 of the Charter,
“A Member of the United Nations which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to the Organization shall have no vote in the General Assembly if the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions due from it for the preceding two full years.”
May I take it that the General Assembly duly takes note of the information contained in document A/54/915?
It was so decided.

With your permission, Sir, I should like to say a few personal words from the bottom of my heart to my friends and colleagues from the Fifth Committee who are present here.
Since my diplomatic assignment will soon come to an end after five hard years in the Fifth Committee and I will be leaving New York, let me use this opportunity to express my sincere thanks and gratitude to all my dear colleagues for having elected me a Bureau member and Rapporteur of the Fifth Committee during the fifty-fourth session, which enabled me to make a greater personal contribution to the work of the Committee than I have ever made before.
I should like to express thanks to anybody in this Organization who contributed to and assisted me in fulfilling my function.
First, I should like to thank our Chairman, Ms. Penny Wensley, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Australia to the United Nations, for her excellent leadership.
I thank the secretariat of the Fifth Committee, headed by Mr. Joseph Acakpo-Satchivi, with the strong support of his Deputy, Mrs. Nora Benary, assisted by staff members Patricia Morales, Mimi Diaz-Westberg and Paul Dysenchuk, who conducted the informal consultations at this session and know well how important a role Mrs. Benary plays in the process of negotiations and in the preparation of draft resolutions.
I thank her very much for that.
I am fully aware that it is impossible to mention all the names of persons essentially involved in our work and who assisted me in performing my function, but let me call a few of them by name: Ambassador Mselle, Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions — it is needless to recall the role of the Advisory Committee in our work; Mr. Joseph Connor, Under-Secretary-General for Management; and his devoted and hard-working staff, especially Mr. Jean-Pierre Halbwachs, the Controller, and Mr. Warren Sach, Director of the Programme Planning and Budget Division of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts.
I should like also like to thank Director Hocine Medili and his highly professional staff of the Field Administration and Logistics Division of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations for their strong support and contribution to our work and to my functions, especially during the second resumed session, which was, as we know, almost fully devoted to the financing of peacekeeping operations — over 20 field missions.
I also would like to thank my wife Lucyna, present here in this Hall now, for her moral support, understanding and patience, especially when I often returned home well after midnight from my Fifth Committee work during the fifty-fourth session.
I wish the Assembly every success in the coming session of the new millennium, especially during the next, when the Committee will struggle over the new scale of assessments, an extremely important and sensitive item for the Member States and for the United Nations.
I wish representatives and their families good health.
May God bless them all.
The Acting President: If there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly decides not to discuss the reports of the Fifth Committee which are before the Assembly today.
It was so decided.
The Acting President: Statements will therefore be limited to explanations of vote.
The positions of delegations regarding the recommendations of the Fifth Committee have been made clear in the Committee and are reflected in the relevant official records.
May I remind members that, under paragraph 7 of decision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that
“When the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, i.e., either in the Committee or in plenary meeting unless that delegation's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee.”
May I remind delegations that, also in accordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.
Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the Fifth Committee, I would like to advise representatives that we shall proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the Fifth Committee, unless the Secretariat is notified otherwise.
This means that where recorded or separate votes were taken, we will do the same.
I should also hope that we may proceed to adopt without a vote those recommendations that were adopted without a vote in the Fifth Committee.

Report of the Fifth Committee (A/54/506/Add.2)
The Acting President: The Assembly will now take a decision on the draft resolution recommended by the Fifth Committee in paragraph 6 of its report.
The Fifth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote.

Review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations

Agenda items 118 and 164 (continued)
Review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations
Human resources management
Report of the Fifth Committee (A/54/827/Add.1)
The Acting President: The Assembly will now take a decision on the draft resolution recommended by the Fifth Committee in paragraph 6 of its report.
The Fifth Committee adopted the draft resolution, entitled “Gratis personnel provided by Governments”, without a vote.
May I take it that the Assembly wishes to do the same?
The draft resolution was adopted (resolution 54/264).
The Acting President: I call on the representative of the United States of America, who wishes to speak in explanation of position on the resolution just adopted.
Mr. Hays (United States of America): My delegation welcomes the resolution on gratis personnel that the Assembly has just approved, as it provides a more balanced approach to gratis issues.
We appreciate the assistance of all those representatives who worked diligently to shape the consensus on this resolution.
However, we also believe at the same time that the resolution could have been even more balanced, particularly in the light of the urgent need of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations for adequate expertise to respond to peacekeeping operations now under way.
As we said during the Fifth Committee discussions last month, the General Assembly should go on record with a clear encouragement of the Secretary-General to use those provisions of resolution 51/243 when warranted.
Those provisions allow the Secretary-General to use gratis personnel under exceptional circumstances.
The resolution we have just adopted does include, although in a somewhat muted fashion, such an encouragement.
In paragraph 5 the resolution recalls the existing mandates under relevant General Assembly resolutions on gratis personnel.
Those mandates of course include resolution 51/243.
In paragraph 4 of that resolution, the General Assembly outlined the exceptional circumstances under which the Secretary-General is authorized to accept gratis personnel.
As described in that resolution, the Secretary-General can accept gratis personnel for very specialized functions if they have expertise that is not available to the United Nations and are used for a limited and specific period of time.
We can also accept gratis personnel if they provide temporary and urgent assistance in the case of a new or expanding mandate, pending a General Assembly decision on the level of resources to meet those mandates.
As Member States, we must realize that there will continue to be unique circumstances when temporary resource personnel in highly specialized areas must be obtained quickly if the United Nations is to do the job that we have mandated it to do.
These circumstances may be limited in number, but the mechanisms to address these needs must not be further restricted.
Rather, they should be made even more flexible to help in handling surge requirements when they arise.
We should not forget that the Secretary-General appeared before the Fifth Committee last October and appealed to Member States to help give him the flexibility to respond promptly and effectively to new challenges as they arise.
If we are to assure that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations can fulfil its mandate, we must respond to this call and provide the Secretariat with the resources needed, in whatever form is most readily available.
The Acting President: There are no further requests in explanation of position.
We have concluded this stage of our consideration of agenda items 118 and 164.

The Fifth Committee adopted the draft resolution, entitled “Financing of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force”, without a vote.
May I take it that the Assembly wishes to do the same?

The Acting President: We have thus concluded this stage of our consideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 128.
(b) United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
Report of the Fifth Committee (A/54/897)
The Acting President: I give the floor to the representative of Israel in explanation of vote before the voting.
Mr. Jacob (Israel): Israel will vote against the draft resolution contained in document A/54/897.
I wish to address, in this context, some recent events that may bring us further up to date on the issues at hand.
As the Assembly may know, the Government of Israel adopted a decision on 5 March 2000 to withdraw its forces from Lebanon.
That decision was carried out on 24 May, as the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) redeployed to the international border.
It should be emphasized that the IDF completed its withdrawal swiftly and with maximum restraint, despite efforts by terrorists in the area to provoke a confrontation.
The IDF, in fact, took pains to avoid any actions that might have endangered innocent civilians, even after terrorists cynically sought to use civilians as human shields.
The Israeli forces were soon deployed safely on the Israeli side of the international border.
Israel has repeatedly expressed its preference for carrying out the withdrawal in the framework of a peace agreement.
However, these efforts were not reciprocated in kind.
Therefore, Israel finally undertook to withdraw unilaterally.
The withdrawal was completed in full compliance with Security Council resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978).
It should be recalled that resolution 425 (1978) calls not only for the withdrawal of the Israeli forces, but also for the restoration of international peace and security and the return of the effective authority of the Government of Lebanon to the area.
Now that the withdrawal has been concluded, we look forward to the fulfilment of the remaining aspects of the resolution.
The goal of bringing about international peace and security, as well as that of restoring the effective authority of Lebanon, is cited in the resolution as an objective of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
Israel hopes that UNIFIL will have the ability and the resources, including the assistance of Member States, needed to rise to the enormous responsibilities presented by resolution 425 (1978).
We expect that the Government of Lebanon will fulfil its responsibility to ensure peace and security within its borders.
International law prohibits any State from allowing its territory to be a ground for terrorist activities.
Israel reserves its right to act in self-defence, should the need arise.
As we have mentioned before, Israel is forced to vote against this draft resolution because it singles out and faults Israel unfairly and entirely for an incident that was initiated by a terrorist group using human shields.
Moreover, it should be noted that this is the only time a draft resolution calls for one particular party to pay damages for the property of United Nations peacekeepers as a result of a clash.
My delegation regrets that this draft resolution has been tarnished by the needless addition of the three paragraphs that single out Israel.
Otherwise, Israel could support this draft resolution.
Indeed, Israel recently took steps to intensify our support for the peacekeeping operations.
As the Assembly will recall, Israel upgraded from group (c) to group (b) in the peacekeeping operations budget.
It is unfortunate that we are forced to vote against this draft resolution in its current form merely due to the confrontational words added to it.
It is time to adapt to the new realities on the ground.
The Acting President: The Assembly will now take a decision on the draft resolution, entitled “Financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon”, recommended by the Fifth Committee in paragraph 11 of its report (A/54/897).
A single separate vote has been requested on the first preambular paragraph and on paragraphs 2, 3 and 14 of the draft resolution.
Is there any objection to that request?
I give the floor to the representative of Lebanon in explanation of vote before the voting.
Mr. Diab (Lebanon): We have heard the representative of Israel attack Lebanon using unacceptable words.
What we would like to ask is, what is the reason in the Israeli definition?
The occupation of Lebanon for 22 years, in violation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978), and the terrorizing of the Lebanese population by killing civilians and bombing civilian infrastructure —
The Acting President: We are in the midst of proceeding to the voting.
May I request that the representative of Lebanon wait until after the voting to explain his vote?
The Acting President: I shall now put to the vote the first preambular paragraph and operative paragraphs 2, 3 and 14 of the draft resolution recommended by the Fifth Committee in paragraph 11 of its report (A/54/897), on which a single separate vote has been requested.
A recorded vote has been requested.

The draft resolution as a whole was adopted by 110 votes to 2 (resolution 54/267).
The Acting President: I shall now call on those representatives who wish to make statements in explanation of vote on the resolution just adopted.
Mr. Hays (United States of America): The United States wants to state its strong support for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which is implementing a difficult and important mandate.
We also support the expansion of this peacekeeping mission that the Secretary-General has recently proposed.
However, we believe that the use of General Assembly funding resolutions to pursue claims against Member States is procedurally incorrect.
This is the reason why we opposed resolution 53/227 last year — and resolutions 52/237 and 51/233 in previous years — since they contain sections that require Israel to pay for the costs stemming from the Qana incident in 1996.
Those resolutions were not consensus resolutions.
Since shortly after the inception of the United Nations, the procedure that has been followed is that the Secretary-General presents and pursues the settlement of Organization claims against a State or States.
This procedure was first begun in 1946 in the Middle East and continues for peacekeeping-related damages claims in the Balkans.
Using a funding resolution to legislate a claim is, in our view, inappropriate.
It also politicizes the work of the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly and should be avoided both now and in the future.
Mr. Diab (Lebanon): I will speak in explanation of vote.
The resolution on the financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) confirmed that it was the responsibility of the occupying State — Israel — to fulfil its obligation and responsibilities under international law.
Lebanon's position is based on the necessity of the aggressor State — Israel — to assume full responsibility for its acts of aggression against Lebanon, especially since the aggression was deliberate and directed against the United Nations.
Israel has ignored General Assembly resolutions 51/233, 52/237 and 53/227, which have determined its responsibility for this aggression.
The General Assembly has once again demonstrated today that when it comes to the issue of financing peacekeeping operations, collective financial responsibility goes hand-in-hand with collective responsibility for human lives, the sanctity of the peacekeeping missions and the responsibility to ensure its safety.
UNIFIL is another peacekeeping mission success story.
Peacekeeping and national resistance have proven to be two fundamental prerequisites for liberation from occupation, a right enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.
We have full confidence in the Secretary-General to ensure that the contents of the resolution will be implemented.
We will continue to monitor the development of the situation, and we hope that the next performance report on UNIFIL will reflect the implementation of this resolution.
Mr. Nakkari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): My delegation has asked for the floor to reply to the allegations made by the representative of the Israeli occupation.
The resolution just adopted affirms Israel's responsibility —
The Acting President: I would respectfully request that representatives limit their comments to explanations of vote.
Mr. Nakkari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): My delegation has asked for the floor to exercise its right of reply to respond to the allegations made by the representative of the Israeli occupation.
The Acting President: As I stated, in accordance with the rules of procedure, the exercise of the right of reply can be conducted only after voting proceedings, and at the end of the meeting.
Mr. Nakkari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): The resolution just adopted once again reaffirms Israel's responsibility for its attack in April 1996 against United Nations headquarters in southern Lebanon.
The Acting President: I will have to ask the speaker to limit his comments to an explanation of vote after the voting.
I have repeatedly stated that, in accordance with the rules of procedure, the right of reply can only be exercised after we have conducted the voting and before the end of the meeting.
Mr. Abdalla (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya): In explaining my vote I shall definitely be replying to some of what the representative of Israel said earlier.
In that light, would the President prefer that I make my statement after the voting procedure has come to an end?
The Acting President: I respectfully ask that the representative of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya wait until the end of the meeting to make his statement, as we are obliged to proceed in accordance with the rules of procedure of the General Assembly.
Mr. Abdalla (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya): I would point out that when Israel spoke in explanation of vote it was permitted to allude to other matters that fall outside the voting procedure.
Thus, we would be obliged to respond to the Israeli allegations in explaining our own vote.
I would ask the President to propose a way in which we can do this, as what we have to say certainly relates to this vote.
The Acting President: I have no intention of denying any Member State the exercise of its right of reply, but I respectfully ask the representative of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to wait until the end of the meeting to speak in exercise of that right.
We have thus concluded this stage of our consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 128.

Agenda item 131
Financing of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
Report of the Fifth Committee (A/54/899)
The Acting President: The Assembly will take a decision on the draft resolution recommended by the Fifth Committee in paragraph 6 of its report.
The draft resolution was adopted by the Fifth Committee without a vote.
May I consider that the Assembly also wishes to adopt the draft resolution?
The draft resolution was adopted (resolution 54/268).
The Acting President: I call now on delegations wishing to make statements in explanation of position on the decision just taken.
Mr. Herrera (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): Let me reaffirm the position that my delegation stated in the Fifth Committee.
My delegation has associated itself with the adoption without a vote of the draft resolution on agenda item 131, but has two concerns.
The first relates to the apparent loss of $375 million, which the General Assembly had authorized 10 years ago for the holding of a referendum, which should have already taken place.
The second is that we do not yet know what options have been presented to the Sahraoui people relating to its future.
We continue to think that the best way to attain our common objective is to proceed to a referendum.
Mr. Zahid (Morocco) (spoke in French): We are aware that the Assembly long ago decided that delegations should as far as possible explain their vote only once, either in plenary meeting or in Committee. But as another delegation has already explained its vote in both forums, my delegation too wishes to do so, with apologies to the Assembly.
The Assembly has just adopted, without a vote as usual, its resolution on the financing of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO).
It was Morocco that had initiated the referendum in this part of its territory, which it regained legally following the Madrid agreement and the opinion of the International Court of Justice.
Morocco has thus given unreserved material, financial and moral support to MINURSO, as acknowledged in all reports of the Secretary-General.
We are convinced that MINURSO, which has made enormous efforts, should continue to enjoy the support of Member States.
In our view, such support is all the more appropriate at this very difficult stage for the mission, when the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. Baker, is using his good offices in an attempt to break the deadlock that has affected the implementation process for several months.
It is common knowledge that the identification process has given rise to widespread dissatisfaction: some 140,000 applicants have been rejected by the identification centres and have appealed their rejections.
Those appeals have been duly received by the relevant United Nations offices.
The first problem that is likely to arise is connected with the various provisions of the protocols and guidelines governing such appeals.
The second problem relates to the registration and repatriation of refugees and of all Sahraouis who reside outside the Territory.
The third problem is that of what has been termed revision: applicants who were accepted by the identification centres and whose names were communicated to us, but who were dropped from the final lists.
Mr. Belaoura (Algeria) (spoke in French): My delegation fully endorses the statements by the representative of Mexico a few moments ago and in the Fifth Committee last week.
We believe that the resolution of the Western Sahara conflict lies in the self-determination referendum that is the cornerstone of the settlement plan.
Through that referendum, the Sahraoui people will be able to express itself on its future in accordance with international law and, particularly, with General Assembly resolutions.
But as we noted last week, we have recently seen certain members of the Security Council and others attempt to change the approach.
This change of approach has affected the last three resolutions adopted by the Security Council on this matter, including Council resolutions 1292 (2000) and, most recently, 1301 (2000).
It also affected the debate on the adoption of the latter resolution, to the effect that the Western Sahara settlement plan that has applied since 1992 could possibly be abandoned in favour of some other alternative.
Let me recall that the settlement plan enjoys the support of the international community and the endorsement of the Security Council and of the two parties.
It is a comprehensive plan whose purpose is to carry out the self-determination referendum for which the Sahraoui people has been waiting since January 1992.
Moreover, in addition to the Security Council resolutions to which I have referred, the last two reports of the Secretary-General have given rise to certain interpretations which, because of problems encountered in implementing the settlement plan, could encourage the search for another option.
For the information of the General Assembly, I should observe that among the problems with respect to the recent reports and Security Council resolutions is that relating to the context in which the resolutions were adopted and to the voting itself — in which, for the first time, there were abstentions and even negative votes.
This new trend can be explained by the existence of problems impeding the implementation of the settlement plan; generally speaking, these include the appeals and the lack of a proper mechanism for carrying out the referendum.
For its part, Algeria considers these to be normal problems that could arise in any such important and complex process, but that can be resolved through dialogue and cooperation between Morocco and the Frente POLISARIO — cooperation which has existed over the past nine years with respect to a number of other problems that I need not go into here.
On the specific issue of the approximately 130,000 appeals by applicants rejected by the MINURSO Identification Commission, there is good reason to apply the May 1999 agreement accepted and signed by the two parties to the conflict, Morocco and the Frente POLISARIO, and endorsed by the Security Council.
The protocols on the appeals process have been issued as United Nations documents.
Algeria considers that, in spite of the present problems, the process of resolving the conflict in Western Sahara has made considerable progress towards the full implementation of the settlement plan.
It would be unfair to ignore that progress, which includes the ceasefire that has obtained in Western Sahara since 6 September 1991; the progress made in the identification process, which has made it possible to identify at least 200,000 individuals in Western Sahara; and the pre-registration of Sahraoui refugees, of whom the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has registered more than 100,000 to date.
It would thus be unfair and unwise at this stage to contemplate the abandonment of this process or of the settlement plan, which represent the fruit of 10 years of effort and human, material and financial investment by the international community.
The question of Western Sahara is a decolonization issue falling under resolution 1514 (XV) adopted in 1960, on which the settlement plan is based, and under the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly each year, calling upon the two parties, Morocco and the Frente POLISARIO, to cooperate with the international community, with MINURSO and with the Secretary-General in the implementation of the plan and in the holding of the self-determination referendum for which the Sahraoui people has been waiting for 25 years, both in its territory and in refugee camps.

Draft decision I was adopted.
The Acting President: The Fifth Committee adopted draft decision II, entitled “Relocation of South Africa to the group of Member States set out in paragraph 3 (c) of General Assembly resolution 43/232”, without a vote.
May I take it that the Assembly wishes to do likewise?
Draft decision II was adopted.
The Acting President: I give the floor to the representative of the United States in explanation of position on the draft resolutions just adopted.
Mr. Hays (United States of America): My delegation has asked for the floor at this time to recall the many serious statements made by ambassadors during the resumed session in May regarding the need to strengthen the United Nations peacekeeping capacity, both operationally and financially.
At this critical juncture, when we are expecting the United Nations to undertake bigger and more complex peacekeeping activities than ever before, it is incumbent on the Fifth Committee to approve those needed resources that will enable the United Nations, and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) in particular, to carry out its critical mandates.
We made important progress towards that end during the resumed session of the Fifth Committee.
Notably, the Committee membership welcomed positive developments in the utilization of the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi and asked that the Secretary-General report to the General Assembly on the review of the concept of the operation of the Base as soon as possible.
As soon as the reports of both the Secretary-General and the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions show that the Base has proved to be an extremely useful and cost-effective means of rapid deployment and procurement for missions in the field, and given its even greater potential for support of current and upcoming peacekeeping needs, the United States delegation hopes that the Secretary-General will, in the context of his review, present, for the Fifth Committee's consideration during the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly this fall, a comprehensive proposal for resources to expand the Base.
Regarding the issue of the support account, the debate was lively and reflected the full range of views of Member States.
The resolution underscores the importance placed by all Member States on the ability of the United Nations to respond and rapidly deploy new peacekeeping operations.
It also highlights the need for adequate funding to enable DPKO to effectively support missions in the field.
My delegation regrets that the Committee was unable to approve the two posts requested for the Rapid Deployment Management Unit during the Committee's deliberations.
However, the United States delegation remains convinced that an effective and enhanced roster system is an important first step towards enabling the United Nations to get needed expertise on the ground on a timely basis.
We hope that the Committee will reconsider the resource needs necessary to strengthen rapid deployment capacity as soon as possible.
My delegation remains deeply concerned that we, the Member States, have yet to deal with the serious needs of DPKO, both structurally and in human resource terms.
With five new, major, complex peacekeeping missions launched over the past year, and a sixth on the horizon, DPKO staff are performing heroically, but there is no doubt that they are stretched to the breaking point.
We wish to draw the Secretary-General's attention to his obligation, reiterated in the support account resolution, to request adequate funding to maintain the capacity of DPKO.
In this regard, we urge him to conduct a thorough examination of current personnel needs, both permanent and temporary, and to determine precisely what additional staff are needed.
In the light of such a review and other relevant reviews, including that conducted by the Secretary-General's panel on peacekeeping operations, the request by the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, we urge the Fifth Committee to consider, during the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, the need for enhancing DPKO's staff.
The membership cannot afford to put the demands of peacekeeping on hold.
While its work is technical in nature, the Fifth Committee deliberations must be attuned to the realities facing United Nations peacekeeping today.
It is clear that unless we take concrete steps to fix peacekeeping now, this core function of the United Nations will remain at risk.
The resumed session represented another critical milestone in our shared endeavour to strengthen the ability of the United Nations to conduct effective peacekeeping operations.
After 27 years, a growing number of Member States have come to recognize the need to create a permanent, stable system for apportioning the expenses of the United Nations peacekeeping operations.
There is no doubt that the future of United Nations peacekeeping depends on a sound, fair system to determine how peacekeeping expenses are borne by the Members.
While there are significant differences that must be bridged, my delegation is greatly encouraged by the degree of common ground that has emerged around the need to address this essential question.
We have heard a wide range of very thoughtful views from delegations from all regions, many of whom echo the same fundamental principles with regard to guidelines for reform of the peacekeeping finance system.
The United States delegation would like to express its appreciation to six delegations in particular — Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Israel, Latvia and the Philippines — which announced their willingness to make concrete financial commitments to the future of United Nations peacekeeping, and to the South African delegation, which declared its strong belief in the need for a secure system for peacekeeping finance and demonstrated its commitment through a voluntary deferral of its well-justified request for an adjustment of its own assessment.
The leadership shown by all of these Member States bodes very well for the ability of the body to reach a consensus for action on this critical issue.
We look forward to continuing the work with all of our colleagues over the coming months and at the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, to devise and implement a series of measures that, together, will safeguard the future of United Nations peacekeeping well into the new century.
The Acting President: We have concluded this stage of our consideration of agenda item 151.

In order to proceed expeditiously on the item, may I take it that the Assembly wishes to consider sub-item (a) of agenda item 97 directly in plenary meeting?
It was so decided.
The Acting President: May I further take it that the Assembly agrees to proceed immediately to the consideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 97?
I see no objection.

Cooperation between the United Nations and the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization
Draft resolution A/54/L.86
The Acting President: I give the floor to the representative of Austria to introduce draft resolution A/54/L.86.
Ms. Schneebauer (Austria): I have the honour to introduce draft resolution A/54/L.86, entitled “Agreement concerning the relationship between the United Nations and the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization”.
May I thank all the sponsors of this draft resolution for their support.
I should like to announce that, since the publication of the draft resolution, the following countries have become sponsors of draft resolution A/54/L.86: Armenia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, China, Ecuador, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Japan, Liberia, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Sweden, Thailand, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Uganda.
The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) of 24 September 1996 prohibits any nuclear-weapon test explosion and any other nuclear explosion.
In the preamble to the Treaty, the States parties to the Treaty recognize that the cessation of all nuclear-weapon test explosions and all other nuclear explosions, by constraining the development and qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons and ending the development of advanced new types of nuclear weapons, constitutes an effective measure of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation in all its aspects.
Thus, the Treaty will contribute to the realization of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
The Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization was established in New York on 19 November 1996 at the first meeting of States signatories to the Treaty.
The seat of the Commission is in Vienna.
The Commission was established for the purpose of carrying out the necessary preparations for the effective implementation of the Treaty, including ensuring the operationalization of the Treaty's verification regime at entry into force.
The Commission established a Provisional Technical Secretariat, which took up its work on 17 March 1997 at the seat of the Commission in Vienna.
By its resolution 54/65 of 6 December 1999, the General Assembly invited the Secretary-General to take the appropriate steps to conclude, with the Executive Secretary of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, an agreement to regulate the relationship between the United Nations and the Preparatory Commission, to be submitted to the General Assembly for its approval.
Following the completion of the negotiations, the Agreement to Regulate the Relationship between the United Nations and the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization was submitted to the Preparatory Commission for approval.
By a letter dated 5 May 2000, the Executive Secretary of the Preparatory Commission advised the Secretary-General of the United Nations that on that date the Preparatory Commission, at its eleventh session, by decision CTBT/PC-11/CR.7, had approved the Agreement.
On 26 May 2000, the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Executive Secretary of the Preparatory Commission signed the Agreement, which is now before the General Assembly for its approval.
The Acting President: We have heard the only speaker in the debate on this item.
We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution A/54/L.86.
May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/54/L.86?
Draft resolution A/54/L.86 was adopted (resolution 54/280).
The Acting President: The Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item 167.
A number of delegations have asked to speak in exercise of the right of reply.
I remind members that statements in exercise of the right of reply shall be limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to five minutes for the second, and should be made by delegations from their seats.
Mr. Nakkari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): I apologize for the confusion, but when we asked for the floor the first time, we did so to exercise the right of reply.
When the presidency said that we could not do so, I sought to explain our position on the resolution.
There has been a misunderstanding: we never explained our position on the draft resolution in the Fifth Committee, but only made a statement, as is perfectly clear from paragraph 6 of the report of the Fifth Committee in document A/54/897.
Therefore, we feel it is only right that we should explain our position in the General Assembly.
The resolution reaffirms the responsibility of Israel with regard to the attack on the United Nations headquarters in Qana.
I would like to reaffirm that, after 22 years of struggle by the Lebanese people, Israel withdrew from Lebanon. This withdrawal, which has yet to be completed, took place after 22 years of destruction, killing and bombing of innocent civilians in Lebanon.
Israel has falsely accused the honourable Lebanese people who were defending their land of being terrorists.
Israel itself has practised terrorism since it was established on the occupied Arab territories.
Israel has disregarded the wishes of the international community, but the international community knows the truth about Israel and its hostile intentions, which are no secret.
Israel should accept liability for its aggression against south Lebanon over the years.
To describe honest citizens as terrorists is to make a false accusation.
Israel must admit to its acts of terrorism, which it has been committing throughout its entire history.
Let me repeat once again that the withdrawal, which has yet to be completed, was not undertaken to show that Israel is a peace-loving nation, but resulted from the courage of the Lebanese resistance, which forced Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon.
Once again, we reaffirm that this withdrawal does not mean in any way that Israel did not commit that heinous crime against the United Nations headquarters in Qana.
It does not in any way mean that Israel should be declared innocent or that it should not be held liable for its crime and pay for it.
Mr. Abdalla (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in Arabic): We are grateful to you, Mr. President, for giving us the chance to speak. We wanted to explain our vote on draft resolution A/C.5/54/L.69.
That right was extended to Israel before us.
At the outset, we would like to place on the record that Israel occupied parts of Lebanon in the mid-seventies.
Israel's declaration of a security zone in southern Lebanon dates back to 1985.
Apparently, we live in a time when facts are being inverted and distorted before the entire world.
Today we have heard the Israeli representative, who believes that Israel was gracious enough for having complied with United Nations resolutions more than 20 years after their adoption.
He even went as far as setting conditions to be complied with by the Lebanese State.
Israel began to implement its withdrawal strategy by punishing honourable Lebanese civilians who defeated Israel and by violating the provisions of the international Memorandum of Understanding concluded in 1996.
I can think of many Christian Science Monitor editorials, but I will cite the issue of 16 February 2000. Bahman Biktiari and Richard Norton provided analyses that compared Israel to a boxer who runs outside the ring and starts throwing grenades at the group of spectators and even at the refreshment stand.
The Israeli representative claimed that the Lebanese civilians who were killed by his country's shells were human shields.
It is a totally unfounded claim not governed by facts or reality.
We would have wanted to believe the Israeli representative that the hundreds who were killed had taken refuge in one of the Lebanese Government buildings or in any other building.
But instead they were killed inside a United Nations headquarters building that is supposedly protected by international law.
However, Israel, which failed to respect any of the relevant United Nations resolutions, thought it could undertake a massive and collective killing campaign of those who decided to resort to the United Nations camp, this time under the pretext that those who took refuge at the United Nations headquarters, which is basically in charge of protecting civilians and displaced persons, were human shields.
The question that arises is, since when have United Nations camps and headquarters become places of refuge for human shields?
Is that a way of questioning the integrity and neutrality of United Nations staff members, or is it simply an attempt to use any pretext whatsoever when other pretexts no longer exist?
What happened in Qana is the responsibility of Israel, the United Nations and the Security Council.
I think what occurred is State-sponsored terrorism, on which the State of Israel was built, and I do not think we have sufficient time to cite the many pages and examples to prove our point.
Those who doubt us could go and read a book entitled By Way of Deception, a book written by a former Israeli spy.
What is really strange here is that the representative of Israel uses the words terrorists and terrorism, while his country was based on the principle of terrorism, on the carnage of Deir Yassin, on blowing up the King David Hotel.
These are good examples of Israeli terrorism.
The assassination of many people in Beirut during the Israeli invasion of Beirut and the carnage of Sabra and Shatila are other examples.
I wonder, are all these people who were killed human shields as well?
It is really astonishing for the Israeli representative to talk about terrorism, while failing to mention that his Government officially acknowledged burying some Egyptian and Sudanese prisoners alive.
It is also strange that the United Nations and the Security Council do not heed such events and do not try to determine the exact circumstances surrounding them and to point out Israel's responsibility.
However, the issue apparently is that we at the United Nations have double standards.
Claiming that attacks by civilian Lebanese people are violations of resolutions is totally unfounded.
Many honest observers, including the United Nations observers, fully agree that such nationalist acts are sanctioned by principles that allow people to defend their country and to evict the occupier.
If Israel wants to enjoy stability, it would have to withdraw completely from Lebanon to the internationally recognized borders.
Has this happened yet?
Has this happened so that we can accept Israel's claim that it has already withdrawn from Lebanon?
No. We do not believe that Israel has actually withdrawn from Lebanon.
We can believe this only when the United Nations and the Security Council assure us that Israel has actually withdrawn to the internationally recognized borders.
Mr. Zahid (Morocco) (spoke in French): I wish to begin by saying that I greatly regret having to take the floor following the statement made by the representative of Algeria because I wished to provide a number of clarifications and respond to some of the things said.
The so-called Western Sahara is an integral part of Moroccan territory.
The colonization of this region came to an end with the departure of the country that controlled this territory, and that was Spain.
As I said earlier, Morocco recovered that territory following the Madrid Agreement and the opinion of the International Court of Justice, which unequivocally established the links of sovereignty — the Arab allegiance, which was the only link of sovereignty at the time — that existed between the Saharan territory and Morocco.
Secondly, Morocco is not a colonial Power, nor an occupier.
Our Algerian brothers are in the best position to judge this because the Moroccan people and the Algerian people have struggled side by side for decades for the same cause.
The Sahara question is a question of territorial integrity, not a colonization issue.
For Morocco, which is convinced of the soundness of its rights, the referendum that Morocco itself initiated can only confirm that territorial integrity.
Thirdly, the Settlement Plan is the product of the good offices of the former Secretary-General, Mr. Péréz de Cuéllar, who authorized it under the provisions of the Charter, rather than under any decolonization resolution.
Fourthly, the implementation of the Settlement Plan has certainly experienced progress, inter alia, the ceasefire, but it has also experienced enormous difficulties.
As the representative of the United States explained so well in the Security Council, we are not going to resolve these difficulties by overlooking them.
Of course, the identification has been completed, and the pre-registration of the refugees in the Tindouf camp in Algeria is almost complete.
However, we must not forget that it is public knowledge that the Saharans of Tindouf have not been able to freely express their choice in terms of the venue of repatriation. Therefore, it is under that pressure that the Saharans were constrained, for the most part, to declare that they wished to return to the east of the sand-wall, which is a no-man's land, a completely desolate, desert, uninhabited area.
Morocco solemnly and officially stated that it can in no way, under any circumstances, accept the displacement of the Tindouf refugees to that location, where conditions for a normal life do not exist.
With respect to identification, everyone, including the United Nations, knows that throughout the process Morocco has rejected the illegal and irregular veto exercised by the other party, on the instructions of their intelligence, of course, against our applicants.
We have submitted to the Secretary-General evidence to that effect.
By way of example I can cite that there were people who even rejected their own family members.
This evidence was communicated to the Secretary-General and United Nations officials.
Regarding our position on the implementation of the protocol and guidelines, Morocco has submitted to the United Nations its interpretation of the implementation of the protocol, which has been published in a document in February 2000, and the Secretary-General has held consultations with a view to arriving at a common interpretation.
Unfortunately, the persistence of the other party and its demands to oppose the participation of thousands of Saharans in the referendum have not made it possible to reach an acceptable solution.
As we know, Morocco cannot in any way accept a referendum in which all the Saharans, without exception, cannot participate.
We want to be optimistic like our Algerian brothers, and we hope that our brothers will help us resolve the various problems mentioned by the Secretary-General in his recent report to the Security Council.
In its most recent relevant resolution, the Council requested that the parties present concrete solutions that could be acceptable to both parties regarding the various problems regarding the Plan's various implementation problems.
I also hope that our Algerian brothers will help us find adequate solutions, which will make it possible for us to conduct a fair and equitable referendum which would not exclude any Saharan from participating in the vote.
That is our fervent hope, and we hope our Algerian brothers will help us achieve that lofty objective that was solemnly adopted by the Saharan tribal leaders — and when I refer to the Saharan leaders, I am referring to the leaders of the two parties — at their first meeting in Geneva in 1990, and that was well before the Settlement Plan itself.
My delegation spoke earlier to recall Algeria's attachment to the Settlement Plan for the Western Sahara and to reiterate its position to encourage the international community, the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative, Mr. Baker, to continue their efforts to implement the Settlement Plan of the Western Saharan conflict and with a view to enabling the Saharan people to express themselves freely regarding their destiny.
Algeria still abides with the peace Settlement Plan approved by both parties to the conflict, the Frente POLISARIO and Morocco, and endorsed by the Security Council.
Algeria is still determined to assist the two parties in finding solutions to the difficulties that have hampered the implementation process of the peace plan in Western Sahara.
The meeting rose at 5.55 p.m.

Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only.
They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room C-178.
Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.
In the absence of the President, Mr. Mbanefo (Nigeria), Vice-President, took the Chair.
The meeting was called to order at 10.45 a.m.
Agenda item 125 (continued)
Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations
Letter from the Secretary-General (A/54/915/Add.1)
The Acting President: In the letter contained in document A/54/915/Add.1, the Secretary-General informs the President of the General Assembly that, since the issuance of his communication contained in document A/54/915, the Congo and Ecuador have made the necessary payments to reduce their arrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the Charter.
May I take it that the General Assembly duly takes note of the information contained in this document?
It was so decided.
Agenda item 49 (continued)
United Nations reform: measures and proposals
(b) The Millennium Assembly of the United Nations
Draft resolution A/54/L.87
The Acting President: Following the informal consultations of the plenary on 2 August 2000 and the agreement reached during those consultations to formalize all the decisions made relating to practical matters for the organization of the Millennium Summit of the United Nations by way of a resolution, I am pleased to introduce to the General Assembly for its kind attention draft resolution A/54/L.87.
The draft resolution, which was issued yesterday morning, was also faxed to all Member States on Wednesday evening, 9 August.
I wish to remind representatives of the need to expeditiously deal with these matters and not to reopen debates on issues that we have already agreed upon.
We need to focus all of our attention on the substantive issues in preparation for the Millennium Summit.
Before we proceed to consider draft resolution A/54/L.87, I should like to submit to members some oral revisions to the annex of the draft resolution.
The following words should be deleted from paragraph 1 of the annex, line 5: “at all times”.
In paragraph 5 (b) of the annex, the following words should be deleted: in subparagraph (i), “thirteen or”; in subparagraph (ii), “thirteen or”; in subparagraph (iii), “five or”; in subparagraph (iv), “eight or”; in subparagraph (v), “seven or”.
I turn now to paragraph 5 (c).
The following words should be deleted: in subparagraph (i), “thirteen or”; in subparagraph (ii), “thirteen or”; in subparagraph (iii), “five or”; in subparagraph (iv), “eight or”; and in subparagraph (v), “seven or”.
I turn next to paragraph 5 (d).
The following words should be deleted: in subparagraph (i), “thirteen or”; in subparagraph (ii), “thirteen or”; in subparagraph (iii), “five or”; in subparagraph (iv), “eight or”; and in subparagraph (v), “seven or”.
I turn now to paragraph 6, which concerns the chairpersons of the round tables.
Paragraph 6 (b) should read as follows:
“(b) The round table to be held on Thursday, 7 September, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., will be chaired by His Excellency Mr. Aleksander Kwasniewski, President of the Republic of Poland;”
Paragraph 6 (c) should read as follows:
“(c) The round table to be held on Thursday, 7 September, from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., will be chaired by His Excellency Mr. Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías, President of the Republic of Venezuela;”
Paragraph 6 (d) should read as follows:
“(d) The round table to be held on Friday, 8 September, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., will be chaired by His Excellency Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria.”
This is the end of the revisions.
Mr. McKenzie (Trinidad and Tobago): We thank you very much, Mr. President, for your revisions, of which we have taken note.
I should like, however, to refer to paragraph 11 and to make a very slight suggestion.
“without prejudice to other organizations which have observer status with the United Nations”.
I am making this proposal in the belief that it will take care of any concerns that may be expressed by other agencies or observers, such as the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) or others.
The Acting President: The suggested amendment has been considered and is accepted, but it should read “observer status with the General Assembly”, not “with the United Nations”.
Mr. Ahmad Chaudhry (Pakistan): I wish to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this plenary meeting of the General Assembly to discuss this draft resolution on organizational matters.
The numerous informal meetings of the plenary that we have had over the past few weeks have afforded all of us an excellent opportunity to voice our views on procedural and substantive issues.
We are happy to note that the draft resolution before us captures the sense of our informal consultations.
We wish to thank you, Sir, and your colleagues for preparing the draft.
We have referred it to our authorities and hope we can finalize it as early as possible.
However, at this stage, since I am opening the discussion, I would like to offer some preliminary comments.
We have only two comments on paragraphs 10 and 11 of the annex.
Concerning paragraph 10, which deals with the summaries of the deliberations of the four round tables, we propose that the chairpersons of the four round tables present their summaries individually.
The paragraph reads “individually or collectively”, but our proposal is for it to be done individually.
Each chairperson should present the summary orally, as a matter of his or her own personal responsibility.
With respect to the same paragraph, we feel that there should be a verbatim record of the round-table discussions.
We know that the round tables are closed meetings.
However, the verbatim records would not be for external publicity but for use by authorized representatives of Member States.
The Security Council holds closed meetings, but a verbatim record is prepared for use by the Council members.
I say this only by way of example.
Furthermore, we see no contradiction between verbatim records and the informal exchange of views.
These records are for posterity and will go a long way towards promoting greater understanding among Member States of each other's frank viewpoints.
Civil society will be represented by the Millennium Forum.
The delegation of Pakistan wishes to underscore the fact that the Millennium Summit remains an intergovernmental event.
For this reason, in our view, priority should be given to the representatives of intergovernmental organizations and to those that have observer status with the United Nations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Having made these preliminary remarks, we wish to assure the Assembly of our full cooperation and support in making this historic Summit a great success.
Mr. Sun Joun-yung (Republic of Korea): I thank the President and the Secretariat for preparing the draft resolution we have before us.
I would like to raise just one question at this stage.
Paragraph 4 of the annex states that
“Each head of State or head of Government attending the round tables may be accompanied by two advisers.”
My question is, these two advisers, does this include or exclude an interpreter?
The Acting President: My view on that score is that that will exclude interpreters.
Mr. Wang Donghua (China) (spoke in Chinese): I would like to thank the President very much for preparing the draft resolution before us.
We do not have any difficulty with most of the content of the draft resolution.
I would like to make a short comment on paragraph 11 of the annex.
We very much understand the non-governmental organizations' intent and willingness to participate in the Millennium Summit.
However, we feel that the Millennium Summit should stress its intergovernmental nature.
At the present stage the General Assembly has not invited any of the non-governmental organizations listed in paragraph 11 to participate in its conferences and meetings.
There is no procedure providing for this, nor is there any precedent for it.
If we were to allow one organization to participate in such meetings, there would be ample grounds for allowing all these kinds of organizations to participate in such meetings.
And if all these non-governmental organizations were to be allowed to participate in our meetings, they would definitely have a negative impact on the smooth conduct of our Millennium Summit.
Therefore, we agree with the position stated by some representatives earlier, that we should allow only non-governmental organizations that have General Assembly observer status to participate in this Millennium Summit.
My second point is as follows.
We have noted that the time allowed for the head of State of each country to make a statement is very, very limited.
This shows that the Summit understands well the procedure of allowing heads of State and Government to make statements.
Otherwise, there would not be any restriction on the time allowed for heads of State to make their statements.
In this regard, on the one hand, the time allowed for heads of State is limited; on the other hand, if we allow certain non-governmental organizations to participate in the Summit, conflicts will arise.
We hope that this potential conflict will be given careful consideration.
As regards the records of the round tables, we support the position expressed just now by the representative of Pakistan.
The Acting President: I thank the representative of the Republic of China.
I will address the last point he made so that it will be disposed of immediately.
That point was raised at the last meeting, and the transcript shows clearly the President's position.
This question was also raised at that meeting by Pakistan.
The representative of Pakistan said:
“I am sorry to take the floor again, but my own understanding of the very succinct presentation by the representative of Singapore and of your own statement, Mr. Chairman, is that there will be oral summaries by the four Chairmen and that the verbatim record will be for the use of delegations.
The President said:
“That is not the understanding; there will be no verbatim records.”
So I just wanted to make this remark known.
As regards the other issues raised, I will leave them to the Secretariat.
Mr. Doutriaux (France) (spoke in French): I wanted to thank you, Sir, for your extremely vigorous efforts to help us arrive at a consensus on this draft resolution.
I just had a minor comment that concerns the intergovernmental organizations that are mentioned in paragraph 11 of the annex to the draft resolution.
France, on behalf of the European Union, notes that we hoped that it would also be possible under certain conditions for the representatives of the intergovernmental organizations listed in paragraph 11 — organizations that have United Nations observer status — to speak at the round tables.
To this end, the European Union suggests that the second sentence of paragraph 7 be amended to read:
“The Holy See and Switzerland, in their capacity as observer States, and Palestine, in its capacity as observer, as well as the intergovernmental organizations listed in paragraph 11 below ...”
The sentence would then continue as now.
This proposed amendment would make it possible for the President of the General Assembly to see whether it is possible for some of the representatives of the intergovernmental organizations listed in paragraph 11 also to speak in the round tables if time allows.
The Acting President: My view is that we will have no objection, but remember that we are constrained by space in the rooms; hence, the maximum numbers referred to in paragraph 5 of the annex.
Those numbers are indicative of the total space available in the rooms.
So, we have no objection as long as there will be adequate accommodation in the rooms.
Mr. Wehbe (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): As a matter of fact, I have a few simple comments with regard to paragraphs 10 and 11 of the annex.
My delegation was one of the delegations that has asked for oral and written minutes to be provided for the meetings of the round tables.
As regards paragraph 10, in addition to the consensus that there should be oral summaries, we would prefer that such summaries be individual for each of the round tables and that the Chairman of each round table be given a chance to give an oral presentation of the summary.
This will provide each country with the opportunity to know what its Presidents or leaders have said, as well as provide minutes for these discussions.
In fact, I could not really understand the last sentence in paragraph 10, which, I believe, has been drafted in such a way as to provoke and does not provide for verbatim records.
I think that this last sentence does not represent the point of view of some of the countries — not just Pakistan — that during the discussions have demanded that oral records and written verbatim records be provided.
I would like to thank the representative of Pakistan for referring to this particular sentence.
With regard to paragraph 11, the delegation of the Syrian Arab Republic supports the participation of the governmental organizations that have the status of observer.
If we allow governmental organizations — and I believe that there was some hesitation during the discussions regarding whether or not to accept governmental organizations — what then is the wisdom of accepting civil organizations, particularly the World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders, since there are thousands of religious organizations all over the world?
I believe that in doing so we would be co-opting the Summit and rendering it a mixture of different organizations.
Therefore, I support once more the proposal of Pakistan that there is no justification to allow the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders to join. I think it is sufficient to allow only the governmental organizations that have observer status to attend.
The Acting President: Let me just say in reference to the last sentence of paragraph 10, that this point dragged on and on and, in the end, a decision was taken and the gavel came down.
What the President said at the time was that he appealed to members not to insist on verbatim records but to leave it to the four Chairpersons to agree among themselves and to make reports to the plenary as appropriate.
That is what I am ruling on.
It has been so decided.
So I will plead that we do not reopen that issue.
On the other point that you raised, regarding religious bodies and the rest, we will be looking at that.
Do you want to engage me in an argument?
I have not given you the floor yet .
Do you want us to play ping-pong?
Mr. Wehbe (Syrian Arab Republic): You have to give me the floor to say whether I want us to play ping-pong or not.
The Acting President: You have the floor.
I do not really want to play ping-pong.
I am not very good at the game.
Surely, it would be enough to have one single sentence without having to say that there will be no verbatim records.
The Acting President: What is your recommendation?
What are you suggesting?
Mr. Wehbe (Syrian Arab Republic): My recommendation is to delete the last sentence.
The Acting President: Thank you, we will think about that.
Mr. Moore (Bahamas): I would like to congratulate you, Sir, and the Secretariat on producing this fine document.
It has some very excellent points.
I would wish, though, to address a few remarks to the question of paragraph 5 of the annex.
I attended a number of informal meetings and discussions on the question of the distribution of members' participation in the round tables, and I was of the opinion that there could have been some flexibility within each grouping with regard to the distribution.
In fact, I obtained that impression from no less a personage than the President of the Assembly.
I wish to draw attention to this and make just one or two minor suggestions regarding paragraph 5, and subparagraphs 5 (a) (iv) and 5 (b) (iv) in particular.
Within the Latin American and Caribbean grouping, we have had a number of meetings and informal discussions regarding how best we can arrange equitable geographical distribution not only for the round table but also within our grouping.
After much deliberation, and appreciating the fact that there needs to be some limit to the numbers in the room, we would wish to make the following amendment to subparagraph 5 (a) (iv), regarding the round table to be held on Wednesday, 6 September: we wish the number “nine” to be changed to “ten”.
With regard to the second round table, we also wish the number “nine” to be changed to “ten”.
The other numbers can remain the same.
In making this suggestion, I was under the impression that there would be some flexibility within the grouping and that the final distribution would have been agreed between the Chairmen of the four round tables.
I would therefore suggest that the starting text of paragraph 5 of the annex have an addition made so that the final distribution of the round tables would be left to the discretion of the Chairmen of the four round tables, with the specific recommendation that subparagraph 5 (a) (iv) be altered from “nine” to “ten” and item 5 (b) (iv) be altered to “ten”.
The Acting President: Let me say that the flexibility the Ambassador of the Bahamas is talking about is obviously built into these numbers.
Only this morning — and that is part of the reason we were late in starting this meeting — we were having consultations with the Chairmen of the regional groupings.
What we find here is the result of earlier consultations and a final consultation held this morning.
I think it would be unwise to start making changes, particularly when the points that the Ambassador has raised have apparently been taken into consideration.
I am speaking about equitable geographical distribution and the flexibility in the numbers.
That flexibility means that we are not going to come up here and say that from the Caribbean, for example, you must have 10 heads of State attending the meeting.
That is not what we are saying.
The flexibility is such that if it turns out that no head of State comes, for example, or that some people do not want to be there, we can have from zero to nine, which is what we have here.
I do not know what statistics you, Mr. Ambassador, have used for increasing your own number to 10, but I know that a lot of effort and consultations have gone into the numbers as you see them here.
The difference between 9 and 10 is neither here nor there.
I appeal to you to leave the numbers unchanged.
Thank you very much for your understanding.
Mr. Darwish (Egypt): It is always a pleasure for my delegation to see you presiding over our deliberations, Sir.
I have some comments to make, but since my delegation previously stressed these points, I will be very brief.
The first comment concerns the last sentence of paragraph 10 of the annex.
My delegation stressed several times that we need to seriously consider having verbatim records for the sake of transparency and for the sake of fairness.
We believe that summary records might reflect some of the points raised, but not all of them. Those records might reflect certain points of importance to some heads of State, but not necessarily to all of the others.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime event, and we have to document it, as previous speakers have mentioned.
My recollection is — and you were right — that our President, in his wisdom felt that there was no agreement on this issue; he said that it should be referred to the Chairmen of the four round tables to discuss among themselves.
My own interpretation, as well as my delegation's, was that they would discuss this issue among themselves and decide whether to have verbatim records or not.
This has to be very clear.
Nothing has been decided.
With all due respect, an issue of this importance should not be decided unilaterally by anybody.
This is the first point I wanted to make.
We fully support — as mentioned — having a representative of civil society speak on behalf of all civil society and non-governmental organizations.
This is fine with us.
Why do we have to allow other non-governmental organizations, given the very limited time available?
This point was highlighted and stressed by our President.
How can we really do this in the light of the fact that the space allotted to our heads of State and Government is very limited?
Of course, we will respect this.
I think we have to apply equal treatment and stress the importance of this event, which is a governmental event, a summit.
We have to concentrate on this point.
Of course, we have no difficulty in giving the right to address the General Assembly to organizations with observer status with the Assembly, not with the Economic and Social Council.
This will also have to be done very carefully so as not to infringe on the time given to our heads of State and Government.
The last point I wish to make concerns paragraph 7.
We have no difficulty in supporting the amendment proposed by the representative of France.
Mr. Apata (Nigeria): I want to start with the issue of paragraph 11, which includes the list of intergovernmental organizations and others who can address the plenary.
At the end, what was decided in our consultations at the last meeting was that all those who are making requests should be listed for all of us to see, and then we can take a subsequent decision. I think that is what has happened with this particular paragraph.
I remember that the representative of Algeria and others raised objections to the inclusion of the World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders on the sound argument that that non-governmental organization and the representative of the non-governmental organization Forum would both be given the floor in the plenary Assembly.
So, to single out one non-governmental organization and give it special treatment would create enormous difficulties for other non-governmental organizations.
Based on that, I think there are solid grounds for deleting the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders from the list of those to address the plenary meetings, while retaining the Millennium Forum, which is a non-governmental organization forum that could address the Summit on behalf of all non-governmental organizations.
Secondly, with respect to paragraph 10 of the annex, your opening remarks, Sir, succinctly summarized what took place: there were a few delegations that wanted verbatim records of the round tables, and after intensive debate the decision was taken that there would be no verbatim records of those round tables, to allow our heads of State or Government to engage in a frank exchange of views.
It was based on that that the President of the General Assembly ruled at that time that there would be no verbatim records.
Hence, paragraph 10 reflects what took place at the most recent meeting of the informal consultations.
